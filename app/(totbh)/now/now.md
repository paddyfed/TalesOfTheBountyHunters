## Personal projects

The last few personal projects I worked on were this [Star Wars Bookcase](https://star-wars-bookcase.vercel.app/) and the [Dracula by Day](https://dracula-by-day.vercel.app/) site. This is the first year I've been following the Dracula story on a day-by-day basis.

I have completed and submitted a [movie site project](https://paddyfed.github.io/movies-movies-movies) for the web development course. Hosted on GitHub pages but I might move it to Vercel after the course is over.
