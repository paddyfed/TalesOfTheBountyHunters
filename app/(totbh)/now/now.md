I'm getting back into reading the canon comics recently and am using [this guide](https://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/2024/01/a-star-wars-marvel-comics-reading-guide.html) to help with the reading order

### Other

Listening to Foundation and Empire by Isaac Asimov on Audible  
Dracula by Bram Stoker on [Dracula by Day](https://dracula-by-day.vercel.app/)

## Podcasts

Dungeons and Daddies. I started listening to this podcast when my son was being born and I've gone back to the start of this again in the last few months. Currently on Season 2 Episode 24 - Spider-Boyz: Homecoming.

## Personal projects

The last few personal projects I worked on were this [Star Wars Bookcase](https://star-wars-bookcase.vercel.app/) and the [Dracula by Day](https://dracula-by-day.vercel.app/) site. This is the first year I've been following the Dracula story on a day-by-day basis.

I have completed and submitted a [movie site project](https://paddyfed.github.io/movies-movies-movies) for the web development course. Hosted on GitHub pages but I might move it to Vercel after the course is over.
