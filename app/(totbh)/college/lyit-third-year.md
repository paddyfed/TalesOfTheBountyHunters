### Subjects

Well third year was interesting. I think I did the least amount of work this year than in the two previous years. It was a miracle that I got such good results. To demonstrate how lazy I was this year: I never 100% completed a week and we missed our very first lecture of the year. All the same we had seven subjects.

**Computer Systems Trends**
One of the more interesting if quite difficult subjects of third year. what made it different was the fact that it was 100% continuous assessment which meant loads of assignments but no christmas or final exam. This subject consisted of learning (or trying to learn) the basics of Java and a bit of ASP. There are some interesting assignments here including the bouncing java ball thing.

**Data Communications and Networks**
A subject that was avoided quite often during the year, mainly because it was on a thursday and friday morning. Nothing too difficult about the subject even though I always got the sub-netting question wrong, damn that one bit!!! Anyway, only two assignments, one of which was a group assignment (what a disaster that was) with a lot of practical things in-between like creating patch cables.

**Project**
The project was the same principal as the one last year, create some system that could be used in the real world or you had the option of creating a game. We had to use Object-Oriented C++ to create the project. I chose to create a Space Invaders game.

**Relational Database Technology**
This subject was mainly concerned with learning how to use SQL and Oracle. It was a difficult subject in that there was a lot to learn and it was also skipped more than once during the year which increased the problems of revising. Thankfully the assignments weren't too difficult because we got a lot of help!!!

**Software Design**
This was the most difficult year of Software Design to date. Not only did we have to learn a new language, C++ which is a big difference to C despite what people say, but we had to use a new approach to software design i.e. Object Oriented design over sequential design. Just a few assignments here.

**Systems Development**
One of the more boring subjects of third year. Its basically a subject all about how to create systems and the different techniques used in designing software (like we haven't been told most of it already!) There was also something in here about project management but to be honest I fell asleep so...

**UNIX**
Has to be the most difficult subject in the whole of third year. Not only do we have to learn UNIX commands but we also had to learn how to become system administrators which is something I don't think I'll ever be able to do, especially with UNIX. On top of all that there were a few difficult assignments in the middle of all that. Lets just say I was glad when this subject was over.

### Nightlife

The big difference between third year and second year was the fact that all the new faces in Letterkenny were getting younger, however not much changed with the nightlife aspect of things.

With the start of college one thing was certain, this was going to be the year in which I really went mad. Of course that really didn't happen because I didn't have the money to but I certainly had a good go. In the whole of third year I missed a handful of Thursday nights and even less Sunday nights out. The basic Sunday night out was get off the bus, go to the flat to leave stuff off, go down to the Oasis to listen to Paul Ward and then on to Bellas in the Grill for a free night in. For a Thursday night it wasn't much different, except we couldn't go to Paul Ward, Karaoke instead, and it was the Pulse where everyone ended up.

This was the format up until Halloween when there was a fancy dress party in the Pulse. Loads of cool costumes were evident as well as a competition for the best dressed person. I, unfortunately, didn't have a costume to put on but I had fun looking at everyone else.

Come November I still hadn't missed a Sunday or Thursday night so I was well prepared for the craziest weekend of the year. It was November 14th and everyone was going out to the Pulse because some people had graduated that day. Not only was it a cool night out but I had other reasons to celebrate because on the 15th it was my turn for graduation. Of course I got so drunk the night before I slept in and if it weren't for Stan would have missed it completely. Graduation went well but I was looking forward to Devaney's 21st birthday which was that night. After listening to Paul Ward for about 4 hours we took an excursion across a golf course to try and get a flag but to no avail, finally settling down in Devaney's for the night. The next day, after a big fry up, we went into Bonnars pub and sat there until it was time to go to Letterkenny for a traditional Grill Saturday night out. After spending the night in Bird's house we left for the pub, again after going to Galfee's for a fry up. We eventually wound up in the Oasis for Paul Ward and into Bellas to finish the night.

After that things continued as usual. I only missed the Pulse on Thursday 21st of November and the Grill on Sunday 15th of December. The CP3 Christmas party took place in the Central again, which was a pretty cool night out and there is a photo taken from that night which I am completely innocent of any wrong doing, I plead ignorance. Just ask Sonya McNally, I didn't do anything to the dress!

Rag Week was between the 10th and 13th of February with the usual old things. There did seem to be less participation from pubs around the town and most activity occurred around the Pulse. Nevertheless there was the traditional stripper event on the Thursday night. However I think that most people were interested in the Ireland match that was on the same day.

Another class night out was the time of Grace's birthday. It all started off with a night out in the Pulse where we met up with Grace. She invited us all up to her house where she had a DJ playing and plenty of drink. It was defiantly the best house party I was at in Letterkenny and went on for ages with such classic tunes as 'Jump Around' and 'Put 'em Under Pressure' blaring from the kitchen. The night ended with some 'jackass' like antics with ironing board and chair sledging down the stairs. We didn't leave that party till early in the morning.

CP3 had two more class parties for third year. The first took place in the Orchard which was a very drunken night out for most people and which coincided with Kieran Supple's 21st birthday. That night ended in the Pulse with everyone in great spirits.

The night Celtic was playing in the UEFA cup final was a very strange night out for me. It was on the 21st of May and everyone was really excited about the match. We met up in the Cavern about an hour before kick-off and had a drink. However the drink wasn't agreeing with me so I decided to stop. This was about half an hour into the match. For the whole time my stomach was doing somersaults and it was all I could do to stop from throwing up. When the match finished I went straight home, not before throwing up three times along the street. I later went off the drink for a few weeks.

This self imposed 'pioneerism' was still in effect when the last CP3 class party took place. It was on the Friday straight after the exams had finished. It started in the cottage for a few and then moved onto McGinley's where there was a drinks promotion for the students of CP3. We then moved onto Gallagher's to listen to a singer who was a friend of Aidan McGuirk's. A few were more interested in the hen party that was taking place next door. The night finished in the Orchard, which was absolutely packed. This was a great night to finish off the year, especially after all the stress people went through for the exams and throughout the year. We all hoped we'd be back for the craic of our final year in Letterkenny.

### College Life

We were in a rented flat this year which meant fewer intrusions by landlords but closer proximity to other people so loud music was out of the question. We still had loads of craic especially being right on top of the front door.

**Staying at Home**

Just being at home and doing nothing was still the largest activity outside of college. This year there was no PlayStation 2 which meant less video games. However when the old PlayStation came up there were many games of CTR which was very reminiscent of last year. Also because we were right beside Xtra-Vision there were a lot more trips for videos and DVD's to pass away the night.

**Going Down Town**

Town wasn't frequented as much this year due to the fact that not much changes from week to week in Letterkenny. The regular trips to Tesco's for the weekly shopping was the only regular excursion to the shops. Well apart from the trips to Vivo's, the Paper Post, SubWay and Xtra-Vision.

**Going to the Cinema**

Not really a regular occurrence but the cinema was frequented a few times during the year especially for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Matrix Reloaded both of which were highly anticipated movies by everyone in the flat.
