### Subjects

Second year went very well for me. A lot of hard work was done and some slacking off was evident later on in the year. Perhaps with a more consistent work rate my exam results would've been better however I can't complain. In second year we had seven subjects.

**Computer Architecture/Operating Systems (CAOS)**

CAOS was one of those subjects that no one was ever 100% sure about. Tommy Devine, while one of the soundest lecturer that you'll ever meet, was very strict when marking exams and often quizzed us in class. During the lectures, however, there was no writing and this was a subject that was avoided especially after Christmas.

**Database Technology**

Database was just that. All about Databases, data modeling, primary keys, foreign keys and normalisation. With only one lecture a week this was a subject that was easy enough to keep on top of even though I panicked after the exams.

**Project**

During second year every student had to create a fully functional system which could, theoretically, be implemented in a workplace. It also had to deal with files and be at least 1000 lines of C code long. I decided to do a Bar Stock Control system.

**Systems Analysis and Design**

Systems analysis & design was a lot like Database in some areas. You had the data modeling and normalisation but you also had areas which were different. Areas that help you create a better computer system or program. This subject was very important when doing the project.

**Software Design**

Again probably the most important subject of the year. I thought after first year that we had learned all we need to know about C. How wrong was I. This year programs got a lot more difficult and things that we thought were complex and difficult last year we were expected to do constantly and without thought. A few assignments for this one.

As well as the five main subjects those in the commercial stream did these additional subjects

**Commercial Programming**

Commercial programming was basically all about Visual Basic and how to create VB programs. I thought this subject was a lot more interesting than C and VB was a lot easier to learn. Maybe that has to do with already knowing C from first year. We also had a few assignments for this class and these programs are a lot more interesting than the C ones.

**Multimedia**

A lot like information systems in first year however there was more emphasis on media preparation and how to create media presentations or applications. We had a big assignment for this which I did on how to play chess. It didn't come out exactly how I liked because I didn't spend enough time on it.

### Nightlife

With Second Year, as you can imagine, it was a lot easier to get into a routine and much easier to get started and actually know what was going on. Some things would never change though, Thursday nights were still the best nights out. This is the story of Second Year.

The start of Second Year brought many new faces to Letterkenny and the realisation that others wouldn't be returning. However Thursday nights were still the same, the big story being the newly refurbished, and highly improved, upstairs in the Pulse. More space and better lighting improved the atmosphere considerably.

By now it was clear that the Globe wasn't fulfilling a role as a good regular pub. The price of beer went up but the quality didn't. The result was a bit of experimentation with other bars in the area. The Oasis bar was now the venue of choice followed by the Pusle every Thursday.

The Grill also had a few good nights in the run up to Christmas. Mauro Picotto was the first major DJ to entertain. This night was the only night that all of the lads from 20 Ashlawn went out. It was truly an excellent night out. Judge Jules also came back soon after this but it wasn't the big event like last year. Also around this time was the Halloween costume party in the Pulse with such guests as Brittney Spears, 4 afro guys and Mother Teresa.

After the last exam at Christmas, CP2 had a small get-together in the Brewery. But the proper Christmas party didn't come until January with the CP2 'Mystery Tour'. After a lot of speculation the bus landed in Kilmacrenan. Even though the venue didn't seem exotic or all that mysterious everyone who went had a great, and drunken, time.

Another great night worth noting was Marcella McGovern's Birthday party. It all started with a session in her house, complete with DJ and decks. We all moved to the Pulse until that finished. It was then back to Marcy's house before heading home, quite drunk, in the snow. An absolutely classic night and one which will not be forgotten in a hurry.

Rag Week 2002 (11/2/2002 - 17/2/2002) was another classic. Monday night was probably the most interesting night with the School Disco and 'Find Your Partner' event. Yes I donned the old SEM uniform and I found my partner. (I was 'son' and I had to find 'Steptoe'). Thursday night was again packed but it was easier to move around. Sunday nights was also a new time to go out with the opening of Bella's in the Grill. Even though the music wasn't great the free entrance wasn't to be passed up.

The Revs came to the Orchard on the 2nd of May and I, of course, had tickets for me and my sister. Not only that but it was Ultan's Birthday celebrations. The night started in the Oasis and moved on to the Orchard for an excellent concert. The night concluded in the Pulse (again) and much beer was taken.

The last week of the Summer exams was the final chance to go out before the Summer break. CP2 finished on Tuesday and immediately went to the Cottage to celebrate/drown sorrows. We then moved on to the Central for much needed food and Karaoke. Finally we all made our way to the Pulse. However Thursday night was still the night to be out and with most people finished their exams it was truly the night to celebrate. Then it was all over for another year, hopefully we'd all be back for more of the same next year.

### College Life

Being in Rented accommodation this year meant fewer restrictions in some areas (and more in others). However having a house of your own without anybody sticking their nose in (most of the time) was a great asset and very relaxing. This is what we did in our spare time.

**Staying at Home**

As you can imagine, because I lived only a short distance from the college I usually went back to the house between classes and when I wasn't doing anything else. Main activities at home were watching TV (especially Cheers and Spin City), playing the PlayStation (too much Medal of Honour) and just generally chilling out by listening to music. Later on when the weather got good we'd sometimes play football in the garden or 'Walle'. Most of the time though was spent sitting on uncomfortable chairs, trying to avoid the shifty Landlord and chatting about Betty.

**Going Down Town**

Sometimes when boredom set in we just had to get up and go down town. Even though we rarely bought anything we just had to do something different for a few hours. Of course if we went down the town that was an assured way of making it rain on the way back up the hill. It usually did the trick, however. We were always marginally less bored when we got back than when we left.

**Sports**

Not a very regular occurrence was the sporting endeavors of 20 Ashlawn. Although we did go to the Astro Turf pitches once which was a good night if a little exhausting. Also while studying for the Summer exams we went to the Pitch & Putt course for a quick 18. Also there were the numerous 'piggy in the middle' events, passing a football between the group.

**On the Computers/In the Canteen**

I didn't spend as much time in the college out of class time this year, mainly because of the house. However the 10.30 break in the Coffee Dock or Canteen was always a good time to catch up on the past weeks events and to look forward to the next night out. Also the Internet wasn't used as much during breaks. With more practical time in the labs I did all the surfing I wanted to do and only rarely went to the labs.
