![I don't have one photo from this week so here's one to make you all jealous](/images/S1032073.JPG "I don't have one photo from this week so here's one to make you all jealous")

So it's the end of another week and it's casual Friday here at Peoplebank. Good to finally get the tie off! This week has been relatively quiet in that we didn't go out on an all night drinking session. Tuesday night we went to a comedy night on William St in the city. It was quite good but a lot of the performers need to perfect (and learn) their set a bit more. We went cause Maria's friend's boyfriend was performing. He was probably the best of the bunch and that's not because he was Irish or that he dragged Sweets up to the stage :D. 
> The main thing I remember about this night was the guy who was introducing the acts. He was terrible, and not in the he's so bad he's good category that some comedians are in, he was just terrible. Completely died on stage and to this day were not sure if he was trying to be bad or if he was just terrible to start with. Either way it was painful to watch.

On Wednesday we had a nice surprise as Yvonne and Becky made dinner for us coming home. It was on the promise that we'd watch a 'chick flick' with them but even the movie turned out to be quite good. Before the end all of the girls had joined us so it was nearly like a house warming. 
> I don't think we had our bathroom door in at this stage so we all had to talk a bit louder when someone was in there. I think this was the first night that we met Siofra, Kim and Leah but I'm not quite sure. Oh the film was 'Freedom Writers', think 'Dangerous Minds' but a lot better.

So Thursday came along and we had planned on making it a quiet night, just a few bourbons and coke that's all. However the electricity had other ideas when a fuse decided to blow. So then it was down to the pub while we waited for the electrician to come and fix it. It wasn't a mad night but it was way past our bedtime when we finally got home, it got fixed by the way. 
> We couldn't fix it ourselves by the way because they were old school fuses and not trip switches or anything like that. Plus we didn't really know where the fuse box was in the block of flats.

Oh and in other good news we finally got our bathroom door but it has no handle (they have to do things in stages here it seems). So the flat is nearly finished and we'll soon be inviting you all to our house warming party. Hope you can make it. On the agenda this weekend is more beer! It's Kat's Birthday this weekend and we're celebrating it as well as the girls moving to Perth for a few days and Brady leaving us for sunny, sunny Ireland. Oh and we reached an important milestone last weekend. We have now been away for 26 weeks and so we are halfway through our little adventure.

Only 26 more weeks to go,
Paddy.
