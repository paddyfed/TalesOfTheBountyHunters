Now that the disappointment of Ireland's elimination at the 2023 Rugby World Cup has mostly gone, there was something that I noticed after the Semi Finals were over. The way that the draw was conducted, althoguh leaving a very lopsided halves, it also meant that the top 4 ranked teams in the world pretty much all played each other over that month period. The exception was Ireland did not get a chance to play France. This made me think, what would a 4 nations tournament table look like if we take these recent results into account. So I decided to tot it all up.

The four teams of course are Ireland, France, New Zealand, and South Africa. Ireland entered the World Cup ranked number one and had high hopes to finally break their Quarter Final duck. The 2019 champions South Africa were their main opponent in their group. While France and New Zealand were set to open the tournament at the Stade de France in Paris.

First we have to deal with the fact that Ireland did not play France so I've taken their most recent game instead which was back in the Six Nations. All other results were from the world cup itself so all of the results are within a tournament setting with most being from the same tournament and at the same time of year. Standard scoring applies, 4 points for a win and 2 for a draw. I'm also using winning and losing bonus points and I'm using the Six Nations criteria to separate teams on the same points. This is because it is more like that competition than the World Cup Pool stage where the result between the two teams was more of a factor.

## Ireland (32) - (19) France

**11th February 2023**
A 4-try win for Ireland gives them a great start in the competition and a full 5 points. No bonus points for France leaves them at the bottom of the table.

**8th September 2023**

A seven month wait until the next match sees France get their first points on the board. With only two tries, there's no bonus points on offer here. New Zealand had two tries of their own but couldn't close the gap for a losing bonus point.

## New Zealand (11) - (12) South Africa

**28th October 2023**

The tournament ends with a tense match between the southern hemisphere giants. South Africa won by the smallest margin, which may have won them the World Cup, but didn't give them enough to overtake Ireland in the table. New Zealand remain bottom on points difference despite the losing bonus point.

So no silverware for Ireland in the real world from this World Cup but they do come top of my imaginary four nations tournament. Every cloud has their silver lining.

Paddy.
