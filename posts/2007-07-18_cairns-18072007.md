So we went out at the weekend but we didn't go to the Sessions Tour thing. We just ended up in the Woolshed again. It's a cool enough place.

> The Woolshed is a good place but after a while dancing on table tops lost it's novelty.  Plus when the football started up I couldn't really enjoy myself as I was always watching the matches.

That was Friday and as you can imagine we didn't do much on Saturday. On Sunday it was the big match, Monaghan in the Ulster final if you didn't know, and we got to watch it in P.J. O'Brien's but without commentary. Even though it wasn't the best result it wasn't a whitewash by any means. Plus we weren't surrounded by Tyrone as we'd feared.

> It was also on this night that we randomly met with Fergal Treanor, another Sem escapee. I guess if you are to meet someone from home, being in an Irish pub when Monaghan are playing in the Ulster Final is as good a place as any. Plus it meant that we could enjoy the match with a few more Monaghan supporters. I think we just about outnumbered the Tyrone supporters. We were definitely louder!

Donegal in the next round then? After that we ended up in the Woolshed (see a pattern forming here). Oh and we think Sweets has got himself a job. He went for an interview this morning and it went well. He'll be supporting us any day now!

Nearly half way to 50,
Paddy.
