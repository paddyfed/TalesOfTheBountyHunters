I felt really sick at work on Monday but thankfully I managed to stay. I was finished up at two so it wasn't a really long day. When I got home though I went straight to bed and didn't make it to football. Thankfully I was feeling a good bit better on Tuesday and I was back in work. I even went out to a house and helped someone to set up their XBOX Live account. Paula came into town then and we got a take away from Little Neroni which was the first time in a while. We also had a bet that Liverpool wouldn't win the Europa League with a Little Neroni as the prize.

Next morning Paula was up early as she wanted to go and do some study. I lazed about in bed for a while but didn't sleep so when I eventually had to get up for work I was wrecked! It didn't get much better in work but thankfully it wasn't a long day either. Adam was back from working in Dawson Street that evening too.

I was in work again on Thursday and Paula was down in Dundalk at a class meeting concerning her lecturer, man that's a long and hateful story! Thankfully it seems to be sorted, kinda. I didn't play football again that evening instead Paula came over and we sent her phone off to get fixed, again. We then headed out to Caroline's for the evening for dinner and to say hello. We were meant to be babysitting but Kevin wasn't feeling well so he stayed instead. So we played around for a while, rock paper scissors mostly, while James made strange at me. We headed back to the flat around eight and just chilled out for a while.

So today I was in work and I was wrecked again, it was a long day but thankfully it went quickly. Eithne called me looking for advice on a PS3 and I also talked to Edel who had her exam today. Apparently it didn't go that well but we'll see. I then talked to Paula for a while and tried to organise the trip up to Eddie Izzard for tomorrow. I'll be heading up on the bus and Edel is coming up on the train. Should be good!

Paddy.
