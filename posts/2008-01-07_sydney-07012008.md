Gotta love being back at work eh? We did have an action packed last week though. On Wednesday we went to a house party as Nicole and Mairead knew a few guys from home who were leaving and we all went out in Kings Cross (yep dodgy). It was a good night though as the place we were in was ok. They had these arcade tables too where you could play Pac-Man and Frogger, retro!
> We actually ended up in Empire which isn't the best club in town. In fact it just about makes it above Scruffys in terms of places that I'd actually like going to. But we did have quite a good night that night. Plus it was the first time we'd ever been out properly in Kings Cross so it was a bit of an experience.

On Thursday we went to the cinema to see 'I Am Legend' which was very good, lots of jumpy bits. We met up with the girls in 'Tea Gardens' for a few quiet ones. Next day Odie was leaving us for the sunny east coast. Mark, Nicole, Mairead and I went to the aquarium and wildlife park in Darling Harbour so I've finally seen a live Kangaroo. The best part of the day was when a butterfly wouldn't get off my Brazil jersey.
> OK maybe that wasn't the best part of the day but it was a bit strange for a while. It meant that I couldn't leave the butterfly enclosure until it left my back and then I had to rush to get out before another one landed on me! It was a good day out and I especially liked the Aquarium and the underwater tunnels. For some reason I seem to be missing photos of that though so I'm going to have to do a search for them.

That night we went drinking in the Junction but didn't venture into town. We did have a nice cup of tea and a chat when we got home. Saturday we met up with a workmate of the lads, Craig, in the 'Cock and Bull' and the decision was made to go to 'Scruffy Murphys'. So we all knew that it was going to be a great night. Thankfully we didn't stay too long and there were no major incidents. Did meet up with my cousin Stephen Treanor though.
> I didn't even know he was in the country so it was a bit of a surprise to see him. We were both standing at the bar and I thought he looked familiar and then I realised who it was.

Sunday we went to the IMAX theatre to see 'Beowulf'. It was ok and the 3D effects were impressive but I don't think I'll see it again. There's a U2 movie coming soon so we may go back for that. Also Ross Noble is playing in April so plan to go to that too.

Work sucks,
Paddy.
