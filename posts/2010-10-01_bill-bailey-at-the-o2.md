Saturday: I was working for a while and we had a RockBand night, the last one in the flat. Emma and Emer were the only ones from work to turn up but Emma and Becky were over with a few of their friends so it wasn’t a complete disaster. Paula came over too after mass at Ted and Eileens, they had karaoke over there too. So it ended up being a very good night.

Sunday: Got up and had sausages for breakfast. Emma and Becky came back to the flat after being out. We watched the [Singapore GP](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/0926/f1.html) and headed to Tescos to get a few things for Mum. We went home for dinner and Paula stayed over for a while.

Monday: I was working in the evening and tried to do a bit of packing but I ran out of tape so I tidied up a bit instead.

Tuesday: I was working in the morning and spent the evening packing. Paula came over and we brought most of the stuff out to the house. Dad came over to the flat too and brought the desk and the rest of the stuff with him. Paula headed home and it was my first night back at home. The room is in a state though.

Wednesday: I was working at 1 and Adam moved his stuff out of the flat today. He had most of the place cleaned and Paula and I finished off the floor by washing it. It ended up being my last time in the flat. On a brighter note, it was announced today that [Star Wars would be released in 3D](http://www.starwars.com/movies/saga/announce3d/index.html).

Thursday: I wasn’t working today. Gerard picked us up around three and we headed down to Dublin to see Bill Bailey in the O2. We met up with Mark and Sarah at the O2 and we nearly missed the singing bit he had at the end. We went for a few drinks afterwards and I really should have stayed on the bottles.

Friday: I lay in bed for most of the day with a hangover. Paula headed to Wexford with Gerard while Emma and I walked around town. I bought a few Star Wars books and managed to get RockBand 2 and Lego RockBand before getting the bus back to Monaghan.

Paddy.
