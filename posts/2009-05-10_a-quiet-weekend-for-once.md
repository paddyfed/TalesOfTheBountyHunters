So not much happened this weekend. I was playing football as usual on Thursday and I nearly went over on my ankle again. Plus I got hit twice in the er... groinal area... not very comfortable! We did win though which was a nice change! There wasn't much happening on Friday either. Paula came over to the flat after work and we had a Chinese for dinner. I also went looking for a picture holder that I think she'll like for her Birthday but I couldn't find anything in Monaghan.

Saturday I was back in work and Ben was playing his antics with Vikki and her boyfriend. It was quite funny actually. Who knew he swung that way - kidding. After work Emer took me out to Argos to see if I could get the picture holder but no luck there either. Paula was studying in the flat but had to work. She did come over for a while after it and thankfully she was in better form than she had been. She's still a bit stressed though.

Today I was out at home for diner. I played Professor Layton for most of the day and I'm in the tower now. So there's not much left of the game. [United were playing City today](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0510/manunited_mancity.html) too and they now only need four points from the next three games to clinch the title. I also ordered a picture holder from Amazon for Paula although it'll take a few days for it to arrive. Hopefully it'll be here before the 19th which is when she's finished her exams.

Paddy.
