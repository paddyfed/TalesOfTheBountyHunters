On Tuesday Paula was registering in college so we headed down to Dundalk for a while. We went looking for more knee supports and managed to get some in Elverys. We also went to Smyths toys and Paula got me a few Star Wars figures, it was 'Training on the Falcon' so [it seemed appropriate](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/07/feeling-much-better.html#falcon). After that we went into PC World to have a look at TV's and I didn't really plan to buy anything but I did see a TV and PC monitor by LG (Flatron M197WD) and it was only 200 so I went for it. The guy who served us turned out to be called O'Hara too so that was a bit of a coincidence.

We headed back to the flat after that and had some dinner and we watched a few episodes of Black Books before Paula headed home. On Wednesday I was working early but we headed out to Carolines house after it. We played a few games with the girls (is she saying lazy boy???) and said hello to baby James. After that we headed back to Paulas and had enchiladas for dinner and watched 'Kung Pow: Enter the Fist' before heading home. Thursday was quiet enough, I was working in the morning again and I headed down to the bookies for a while after it. It was football again that evening but nothing else interesting.

Today though we're heading out to Deerys for the third time in five weeks as it's Adam Jebb's 30th. I hear the cake looks great too so it should be a good night.

Paddy.
