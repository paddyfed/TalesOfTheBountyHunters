Woohoo! Finally I have a job and can continue with this whole adventure. Ironically enough I'll be working in a recruitment agency finding jobs for other people. I went for the interview on Thursday and they said I can start on Monday.
> Before the interview I had to head to Myer to buy a tie and put it on on the way down Pitt St. It was Mario that I was talking to first and then Darren came in a bit later. They pretty much offered me the job on the spot. Later they told me that they just wanted to make sure that I didn't have two heads or something.

It's come just in time too because we'll be heading to Melbourne on the 5th of November. Plus they said if I ever wanted to do any more travelling that I just need to let them know in advance. To celebrate all the guys in the room I'm in went out for drinks and that lasted for most of the night.
> We went to the Scubar which was just down the road from the hostel. We had started off in Sidebar but it was empty so we moved on from there. Scubar is not the best pub in Sydney, and the drink was a lot more expensive than Sidebar, but we made a great night of it.

Then last night we went to Cargo Bar at Darling Harbour. It's a lot more up-market than we're used to but the two German lads, Marco and Seb, work there so we decided to check it out. Good times.
> This was the first time that I'd been in the Cargo Bar and the first time in this type of bar in Sydney. Mostly we'd stayed in backpacker bars or Irish bars so it was a bit different. The fact that you had to wear a shirt and shoes threw me and annoyed me. It was still a great night though so you can't really complain.

Oh yea and we have the Killers on the 11th of November to look forward to. The only thing we need to do now is find somewhere to live for the next while.
> Which thankfully didn't take us too long, and by 'us' I mean the two lads who did all of the work and not me who had to work all the time.


Good times,
Paddy.
