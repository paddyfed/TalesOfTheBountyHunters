On Wednesday Neil wasn't feeling well so I was called in to work early, thankfully it wasn't too bad and I got away a bit early too. Paula then came over to the flat for dinner, we had fajitas, and we stayed in and watched 'Spinal Tap' on DVD. It was a really great evening and we hope to make this a Wednesday tradition as it's the only time we ever really get to see each other properly. Though I did find out that I would be working down in Dundrum all of next week. There was football on on Thursday as usual but unfortunately the lights went out half way through so the match had to be abandoned. I wasn't too upset as I was already really tired from work.

We headed down to Dublin on Friday morning and dropped our bags off in the Ilac centre. We got a cuppa and a slice of cake in the Jervis and then headed out to Dundrum. We didn't get to leave until very late, which became the norm for the week, and we finally booked into the Beacon hotel at about eleven at night. Saturday we were up early for work but we were a bit late arriving as we couldn't find the Luas stop. I was finished at five and I headed back to town to get a bus. I decided to get the 6:15 bus but it wasn't actually running! So I had to rush to get the next Bus Eireann bus. Paula made me a lovely dinner when I got home though and we watched TV for the evening.

On Sunday Paula's friend Edel was playing in a football final so we went to watch that, they did lose though which was disappointing. Paula left me back home as it was Mum's Birthday. She stayed for a while but had to go home to do some college work. We had a lovely steak dinner at home and we had a few drinks in the front room. It felt very like Christmas! I stayed at home that evening and got a bus with Edel Monday evening. We watched a few episodes of the Boosh on her laptop too which was cool. When I got back to the hotel I had dinner and a few drinks with Adam and Ben before heading to bed.

Paddy.
