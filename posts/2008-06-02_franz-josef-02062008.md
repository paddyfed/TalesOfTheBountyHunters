Everybody should do a Bungy Jump! Seriously! Feckin' brilliant! 134 metres above the Nevis river. It's hard to describe the feeling, it's a bit like the skydive but maybe even a bit better! Anyway after the jump I went for a few drinks with a guy that did the bungy with me, Grattan, and met up with another mate of his, Dee. After a few games of pool we went back to the hostel for something to eat and then it was back out again for a few more drinks. Got back to the hostel a bit late, not before climbing a few trees though! Next morning, with a fantastic hangover, we drove the five hours to Franz Josef where we planned to hike the glacier. Turns out it's booked up so we'll be heading back down the coast to Fox glacier to hike that one instead.

10 days to go and go do a bungy!!!
