Monday at football and one of the guys decides to tackle me and nearly break my ankle! It swelled up and I was limping around on it for ages! Plus it was only about five minutes into the match and I had to play in goals for the rest of the time because I couldn't run! Seriously pissed off after that! It also meant that I couldn't play on Thursday either as it still hadn't healed up.

We did head to a table quiz that evening though. However when we got there it had been cancelled so we watched a darts competition in the Shamrock instead. Well that and the netball that was on the TV. Adam didn't come along as he was at a concert in Dublin and nearly lost his hearing. Don't stand so close to the speakers!

So Friday came around and we were heading down to Dublin to the Killers concert in the O2. We headed off at about three and picked Emma up on the way. We stopped in Paulas Aunt's house to park the car and then went to the flat. After a bit of pizza we went down to the Jervis centre to meet up with Becky as she was working. We got a taxi down to the O2 and thankfully the traffic wasn't to bad. The concert was excellent, by far the best Killers concert I've been to. They played a god few songs from their new album but they still had loads of songs from their other albums to balance it out.

After the concert we headed back to the flat. On Saturday we headed back up the road, but not before Paula's back decided to play up. Thankfully it wasn't too bad and we stopped in Nora's again for a cup of tea. When we got back home we dropped Emma off and headed out to Emyvale for a 21st birthday in the Scarna Inn. That was good and it was the first time I'd been in the Scarna in about nine years I think. I stayed in Paulas that night. Sunday we hung around the house for a while but I went back to the flat at about five and then went home for dinner. Eithne, Johnny, Joe and Eileen were all there and we had a great game of 'guesswords'. Gotta love that game.

Next week we should be down in Dublin for an Australia reunion. It'll be good to see the gang again.

Paddy.
