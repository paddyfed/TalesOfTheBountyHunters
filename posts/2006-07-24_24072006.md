So I've moved out of home at last. Moved into a flat with Adam in the middle of town. It's so handy for work and going out. Plus I won't have to wait on lifts anymore.

Went up to Letterkenny again with Mark. Brian was off for a few days and Bird was at home so we went up for a few nights of madness and birthday celebrations. We did start off in the Cottage (God I miss that pub) but I don't really remember the sequence of events. I do remember being in Milan and the Grill though but which days they were I'll probably never know.
