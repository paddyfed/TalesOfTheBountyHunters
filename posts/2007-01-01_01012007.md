It's 2007! Didn't go out for New Years though because it's usually shite. Stayed at home and played Poker with Mum, Dad, Daniel and Ryan. It was good craic and I managed to win in the end. The only disappointing thing about staying home for new years is that there's no real excitement when the clock turns 12.

On Saturday night Landers, Adam, Gemma, Darren (who was back from England for Christmas) and Darren's sister Louise all went out for a few drinks. We met up in McKennas before going over to the Pig. There were a good few people out and I met up with a few guys who I hadn't seen in a long time. We then found the mythical free bus to take us to the Seasons (Or Lotus One as it's now known). There we just had a mad nights craic with much drunken dancing! Later Gemma, Darren and I went back to the flat to play the Wii and Gemma whipped us all on Wii Sports bowling.
