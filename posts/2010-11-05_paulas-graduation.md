Saturday: We had to be up early and got ready for Paulas graduation. She was up to get her hair done and we were just about ready when she got back. I sat in the Whitaker theatre while everyone else was in the hall. Paula looked very nervous getting her scroll but it all went fine. We went to get photos taken and went to the Malthouse for some lunch. After that we booked into the hotel and rested for a while. We went to the shop to get a few things and Edel arrived soon after. We headed down to her room for a few drinks. We then headed to the Graduation ball which ended up being a good night despite the shaky start. We eventually got back to the room by half two.

Sunday: We were up around eleven and Sean collected us as we were heading to Francis dinner in the Westenra. It was a really nice meal and there were a few bouncy castles out the front in the newly refurbished diamond and even a huge Zorb ball. We headed home and Jarleth Colloran brought his three children over for Trick or Treat. We went to get a DVD to watch but unfortunately the DVD player was broken so we watched NFL instead. Gavin finally proposed to Sorcha today too.

Monday: We were up around ten and I headed home for my Football gear. I was working at one and I had a sore stomach all day. Paula picked me up from work and I still headed to football. I even scored a few goals despite Colin trying to foul people a few times.

Tuesday: I was working until four so I did a bit of shopping in town. I met Aine and Bob and I was chatting to them for a while. I headed to Paulas house for dinner and we went for a walk around the village and we posted a letter for Paula.

Wednesday: Paula left me home early in the morning but I wasn’t working until one. Gerard was working late that evening so he picked me up and Paula had dinner ready when we got home. We went for a run in Emyvale and it was bucketing down with rain. We all had to have showers straight away when we got home.

Thursday: Work and Football today which is all I seem to do these days. We didn’t win and I didn’t enjoy it at all. (It must’ve been a bit of a moaning day today!)

Friday: I was working today and then Paula picked me up. I was in a foul mood for most of the day. Paula had made dinner and Elaine and Mairead were over too. Paulas picture was in the Standard for her Graduation. We played Professor Layton for a while and then went to bed.

Paddy.
