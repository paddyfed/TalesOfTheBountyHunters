I was bored and started messing round in Blogger with layouts and things and decided to make a header image for the site. It's nothing special just a little throwback from the first Star Wars book I ever got. As you can guess though it's not my work. It was actually cover art created by [Stephen Youll](http://www.stephenyoull.com) and he has some other class pictures on his site.

Maybe someday I'll be a bit more creative with it.
