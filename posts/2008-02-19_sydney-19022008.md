Lots of exciting stuff to catch up with this week. Wednesday and Thursday was the work conference in Terrigal. It was a conference for all of the branches of Peoplebank and Ambit around the country and there was a 70's themed dance on Wednesday night. It was all good fun and everyone went to the nightclub that was attached to the hotel we were staying in.
> The conference was your usual boring corporate things but it was really cool to see the video that they filmed a few weeks back. I think I was in it a few times but Karynne and Chris really featured in it. The free drink all night helped with the good times, especially when it continued into the nightclub.

Thursday we were supposed to be doing activities like abseiling and horse riding in Glenworth Valley but most people just slept in. We did eventually go for lunch though. After that it was back home and we all went for a drink back in Sydney. Of course my bag didn't come back with us so we had to track that down (it arrived on Friday).
> We all just sat around for a few drinks at Ryan's Bar in Australia Square while Don tried to figure out where our bags had gone!

Thursday night was of course Valentine's Day and Maria, Paula and Elaine had invited us out for dinner and drinks in Coogee. A very enjoyable, and romantic night.
> There was this Valentines night special where you got a meal for two with a free bottle of Champagne and a rose for the lady. I guess it wasn't anything really that special but it was a good night out with the girls and it was a good laugh. Looking back on a few photos it seems that this is when the girls moved into Kings Cross so we could've been celebrating that too.

Friday night we went out in Coogee again as Laura was leaving us (ahhh). But on the up side Kat was back (Yayyy). A very drunken night and lots of dancing and jiving! Saturday was a quieter affair. We went over to the girls flat in Kings Cross to watch a few DVD's and then went out to Mansions.
> Have to say that this night out was one of the best nights out and probably one of the last ones as the big group. We got some fantastic photos and if it weren't for Landers camera being slow he would've got the best photo probably of his life!

We stayed there all night and I even managed to watch the first half of the [United - Arsenal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0216/manunited_arsenal.html) (what a result btw). Finally left the pub at 5 in the morning!
> This was a funny night because I was out with Paula watching the match and she was falling asleep in the pub so that's why we only saw the first half. I walked her home and stayed in the girls house as I wasn't going to bother getting a taxi. I'm to cheap for that!

Sunday we again went to the 'Cock and Bull' for some Sunday drinking, y'know the usual. This weekend we're heading up to Palm Beach for some sun and surf and we'll probably head out at some stage or another.

Surf's up, Dude,
Paddy.
