So here is the story of the stag party. Names and events have been changed to protect the innocent! It's the first stag that I've ever been on so it was going to be an experience. On Thursday afternoon I got the bus up to Letterkenny and met up with Damian and Darren in the shopping centre. We then picked Carlile up and headed to Derry to catch our flight. Carlile nearly lost all his liquids in his bag too as he didn't declare them! We arrived in Liverpol and booked into the hotel and had a few drinks. We then met up with Niall and Andy and went out on the town. We ended up in the same place I was [the year before](/posts/2008-06-17_monaghan-17062008) and it hadn't changed much. We ended up in a nightclub drinking whiskey and other shots and landed home at four in the morning.

On Friday we didn't get up too early but we headed to O'Neills for a fry. We then pretty much started drinking here and then. I did go back to the hotel for a power nap though as I was exhausted and still a bit hungover. After the nap we met up with the other guys who were coming over and we went for a drink and had a few games of pool in the hotel. We went to a few clubs and pubs and we eventually went to a club that stayed open until seven in the morning. I landed home at about six though but not before I had a subway!

On Saturday we got up late again but this time we started drinking at about three in the afternoon. We basically stayed in the one spot all evening and we started on the shorts very early. We sat there for a while but then tried to get a club to go to. We tried a few places but everywhere was empty! We settled on another pub but by this time it was nearly three in the morning and I was wrecked. I eventually stumbled home and went straight to bed.

Sunday morning came too soon! We had to get up early for our flight back to Derry and I thought at the start I'd be alright. As soon as we got in the taxi though I knew I was in trouble. We just about managed to scrape enough money to get us there and it was a struggle to not be sick. When we reached the airport I couldn't hold on any longer and then that was me for the day! The plane home was an adventure, I'd never gotten sick on a plane before, and I was still heaving in the car back to Letterkenny. I stayed in Carliles for a few hours resting and eventually got the bus back to Monaghan. Needless to say I was glad to get home, I was still feeling the effects at football on Monday evening!

So for the most part it was a fantastic weekend. The lads we were out with are all really sound and I'm really looking forward to the wedding in a few weeks time to catch up with them all again.

Paddy.
