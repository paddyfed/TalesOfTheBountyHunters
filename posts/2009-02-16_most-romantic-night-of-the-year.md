So Wednesday night we went to the Pig to watch the [Ireland vs Georgia](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0211/ireland_georgia.html) match and it was terrible. Two late goals and we were very lucky to get a win, and that was at home! We sat in drinking for a while and actually got two free pints as two of the bouncers who work there gave them to us as they were heading home. So that was good.

On Thursday Adam's brother Sean was staying with us and Flynn also came over to the flat for a visit. I also was talking to Edel and she managed to order tickets for Ross Noble in Dublin in May so I can't wait for that! Friday night I headed out to Paulas to watch a DVD, it was 'Burn After Reading'. That was grand and it was a good night but when she was giving me a lift home some wanker jumped out in front of the car! Luckily Paula saw him in time and stopped but she was a bit shaken after it. That's one bad thing about the flat, too many drunk wankers around on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday night.

Anyway on Saturday it was Valentines Day and I hadn't anything planned really. We both couldn't afford to eat out somewhere and besides it's always very busy. Instead we got a carry out from the Little Neroni and it was fantastic as always. So we had a nice relaxing time in the flat, watching DVD's and other crap on TV. Paula also bought me a jacket and a new belt which I wasn't expecting but was much appreciated. All in all it was a good valentines night.

On Sunday I headed out to Adams house as we were watching the [Italy vs Ireland](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2009/0215/italy_ireland.html) match. It was a good result by Ireland but it wasn't really a convincing performance. Italy just didn't have the quality to stay with them for the whole match. Still it was a good result. After that we just sat around the house and played Mario Kart on the Wii and Wii Sports. I like Mario Kart alright but I can't get used to the wheel controls. I think I'd prefer the normal controller.

Anyway next weekend it's the Killers in the O2 and so we'll be down in Dublin for the weekend. Can't wait!

Paddy.
