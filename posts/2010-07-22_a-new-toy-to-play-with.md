I wasn't working on Monday and Paula left me back into town in the morning. I sat around the flat all day and played a bit of 'God of War' and we went to football in the evening. I'm really not enjoying football though. I thought a few weeks off would do me good and I'd want to get back into it but that didn't seem to work. To top off a crappy day Paula had to go to the doctor because she had a swelling under her chin.

Next morning Paula left me back to the flat and gave me the card and present. As I thought she had no need to worry. She bought me a new Creative Zen X-Fi MP3 player. With built in Wi-Fi, an external speaker and 32gb of memory it's a big improvement on the old Zen Vision:M that I have, especially with the broken screen. Though it served me well all through [Thailand](/tags/Thailand), [Australia](/tags/Australia) and [New Zealand](/tags/New%20Zealand) it will soon be time to retire it. It'll still go to good use in work though.

We went for dinner in the Pig that evening and met up with Brian and Marie for a few drinks. We were in the Pig for a few and then moved to McKennas to see an open mic night but unfortunately it had been cancelled. Ben was there too as he was supposed to be playing. Paula went back to the flat early and I eventually got back at around half one.

I was working this morning but I thought I was in at ten but in fact I was in at twelve. So I could've stayed in bed for another two hours! Thankfully it wasn't too long though and I was actually in a good mood mostly. I was back at football too and I did enjoy it a bit better but not by much. That was about it today though. Paula was helping look after the girls and James and we are going to see 'Toy Story 3' tomorrow in Armagh.
