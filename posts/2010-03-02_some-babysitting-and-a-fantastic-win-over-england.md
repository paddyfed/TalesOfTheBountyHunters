I was working on Friday but thankfully not in the evening. Instead we headed out to Carolines to do a bit of babysitting for her as she was away for a spa weekend. We made our curry dinner, played about with the kids (even James was happy and smiling at me) and then helped Kevin put them to bed. We then watched Up on DVD. The girls had us up early on Saturday and we took Ciara to her swimming lesson. After that we headed home and then took her to a birthday party in Planet Kids. I headed out to Adams house after that to watch a [fantastic win over the old enemy of England](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0227/england_ireland.html)!

We didn't really plan to head out but Sean was having a going away party in the Lost and Found and Ben was playing at it so we decided to go to it. We then got very drunk and headed back to the flat. Paula was out that night too and she came over to the flat to stay the night.

The next day the hangover was killing me! I stayed in bed most of the day and couldn't even get the energy to say goodbye to Paula. I was going to head out to Adams again to watch the [Carling Cup final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0228/astonvilla_manchester.html) but decided against it in the end. The [Ice Hockey gold medal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/2010/0228/icehockey.html) was on that evening too so I watched it.

I was back to work on Monday after an all too quick weekend. Thankfully Paula came over after college and cheered me up though she had a bit of a sore back. We got some heat patches for her and she headed home. It was a really close match in the football that evening too and it was a really good match even though my team lost by 2.

I was working again today and I bought Hello Kitty roller rescue for Ciaras birthday, I'm sure she'll like it. [Ireland were playing Brazil](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0302/ireland__brazil.html) in a friendly too and they played really well in the first half but lost their way and became a bit tired in the second. Still not a bad match though.
