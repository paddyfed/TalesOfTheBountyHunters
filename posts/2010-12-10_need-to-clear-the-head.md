Saturday: It was the day of Elaines party. She headed to town early and we got the house ready. We then went to town ourselves to pick up the cake and pick up a few other things before heading back home. Elaine was a bit upset cause her real party had to be called off but when a few of her friends arrived at the house it was all right, the cake was a big help too. We watched a slide-show of old photos and then brought out the cake and we had a bit of karaoke in the front room before everyone went home to bed.

Sunday: Paula wasn't feeling well today at all. She lay about the house and had very little energy, she was also quite down and very quiet. She decided to go to the doctor to talk to him about it. I felt a bit sore in my stomach also and it got really bad around eight in the evening. I nearly passed out from the pain and felt very feverish. Gerard had to give me a lift home and I went straight to bed with three hot-water bottles.

Monday: I went to the doctor in the morning and he said it was a stomach bug and to rest for a few days and it should clear up. I was still sore to touch and a bit nauseous at times but not too bad. Paula was also at the doctors and she's off for two weeks to try to clear her head. They tried to head to Enniskillen with Sean but the snow was too bad so they had to turn around. I spent the day playing Halo on the XBOX.

Tuesday: I spent the day in bed today. I wasn't as sore as before but still wasn't great. So I spent the day playing Halo and texting Paula.

Wednesday: I was back to work today as I was feeling much better. I had to get a taxi in but Gerard collected me and we even got a Montie for dinner too.

Thursday: Today the DSi bundles went down in price to &euro;165 so Paula and Caroline came in to buy two for the girls. I went out to Paulas house afterwards and made spaghetti for her ones.

Friday: I was working from 12 to 4 and we headed to Cavan to visit Mum in the evening. She was in good form and she might get home on Sunday or Monday. Paula went down to Gorey with Elaine for the weekend so that she could get out of the house for a while.

Paddy.
