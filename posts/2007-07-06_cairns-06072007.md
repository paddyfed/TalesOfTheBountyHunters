So we're still in Cairns and still in the hostel but we've been taking it easy over the last few days. The weather has been great and we had our first outdoor BBQ the other day. Nothing special just a few sausages and burgers. It was good!

> In case you don't know, in a lot of parks and outdoor places in Australia they have these outdoor barbecues that anyone can use. They're like these gas powered hotplate things. So it's not a proper barbecue but it's a really good idea.
 
We're fairly sure that we've got the house that we were looking at. It's a bit away from the city but it's a great house and there's everything we need near by and loads of buses going in and out. Hopefully we'll be moving in on Sunday (fingers crossed).

> Of course at this stage we didn't know that the woman who owned the house was a lesbian or that she'd be staying with us for the first few weeks. Oh the excitement.

So there's not much else happening, the job search has started though. Hopefully we'll be able to find something so that the adventure can continue. Oh yea and I got a phone at last. I'll send the number in a list so check that out and send me a few txt. I probably won't have your number in my phone though so just let me know who you are!

> Of course as soon as I posted this the phone stopped working. Apparently it had something to do with a number of faulty sim cards that Vodafone were selling.


Oh yea, Happy Birthday Daniel. Even though you're not on Bebo.
Sweet sixteen and never been kissed!
Paddy.
