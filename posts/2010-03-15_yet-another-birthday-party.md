I was working this Friday evening until 9 but Paula picked me up and we headed out to her house for dinner. We were going to watch a DVD but The Matrix was actually on the TV so we watched that instead, well I watched it, Paula was too tired and fell asleep soon after it started. It was still nice lying up on the couch together though.

On Saturday Paula left me over to Adams for the [Ireland and Wales match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0313/ireland_wales.html) and it was a fantastic result yet again. Although Wales had a lot of possession and territory they never really looked like scoring a try and Ireland always looked dangerous on the break. Paula then picked me up and we headed out to go to Francis 50th party. There was some great food there and we sat chatting to everyone all night. Getting the photos taken was a good laugh too. We headed back to Paulas house soon after that.

On Sunday morning it was the first F1 Grand Prix of the new season and it was [won by Ferrari debutant Alonso](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/0314/alonsof.html). So even though Schumacher is back it might just be Ferrari's season. It was also Mothers Day so I headed home for my dinner and everybody was there too which was a bit of a change. Also [Trap-Jaw](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.171121800) had arrived and he looks severely cool.

I was working until two today and I've been trying to fix Elaines laptop for her but to no avail. I was at football and although we won it didn't really feel like a good match as Colin wasn't really in the mood to be playing but that wasn't surprising. I've now re-installed windows XP on the computer and it seems to be going alright for the minute but it'll need a good virus check and a check for malware before it's done. Oh and Dad text me earlier, apparently [Battle Cat](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.171121900) has arrived! Can't wait until Sunday!

Paddy.
