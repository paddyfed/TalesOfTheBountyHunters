It was Adams 21st last weekend and we had a great time. First of all myself and Adam had a few cans in the flat on Friday night whilst playing Guitar Hero. The next day after playing a few games of darts on Warioware in the Wii Adam went for a meal in the West with his family. I met up with all of the GAME crew in the Tavern before going upstairs to meet up with Paul and Sinead. Later on Adam joined us and Brian and Landers came round for a few drinks. Then Nikki, Nicola, Emer and I went to the Shamrock to see Leona who was working that night. We had a few drinks (which turned out to be doubles) and then went back to the Tavern. We then went back to Michelle's house to play drunken Buzz. Later I found out that I was supposed to meet up with Brian and Landers in the flat but in my drunkenness I'd forgot all about it.
