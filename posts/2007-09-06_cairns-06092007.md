This week has been really quiet, I mean more quiet than usual. We did go to see 'The Bourne Ultimatum' which was very good, I'd highly recommend it especially if you've seen the first two. It gets a Paddy O'Hara four thumbs up rating. We also saw the new Die Hard movie which was great too, especially as I wasn't expecting much.
> I'd actually forgotten about a night out that we had up in Cairns. That is until I looked back at some of the photos. It was on the Saturday before this post that we went to Gilligans Backpackers which had a bar and night club attached to it. I think it was just an attempt to go somewhere different. It turned out to be a decent spot too. It had a small VIP room at the top of some stairs however all you had to do was wait for someone to leave to get in. A one out one in policy if you like. We spent most of our time out the back in the smoking area though. It was a bit quieter and it wasn't a bad place to check everyone out. I do remember this weird guy coming over to us though and telling us something about climbing the huge fence that surrounded the back of the club. Not a bad place for a night out and I guess not such a quiet week as I originally remembered.

We're gearing up for the Rugby next week-end too. The lads will probably miss the first match cause they're working on Monday (the matches are on at 5 in the morning after all) but we're assuming that they'll be replayed or highlights at a more reasonable hour.
> I never really remember getting to see any replays either. Yes they had coverage during Sports Tonight on Ten but it was comparable to watching the highlights of West Ham and Reading on Match of the Day i.e. only on for about twenty seconds. So apart from the Australian, the New Zealand and, God help us, the English matches there didn't seem to be any coverage. The annoying thing being that RT&#201; probably had extended highlights of all matches in the tournament. Ah well in the end there wasn't much to see.

The other matches are on during the weekend so we'll just be able to stay out and watch them then. We'll find out soon enough.

C'mon Ireland!
Paddy.
