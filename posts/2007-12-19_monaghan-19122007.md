Yep, you read correctly, I'm back in good old County Monaghan for Christmas. Don't be surprised if you didn't know seeing as the only people who did were Edel, Karen and Adam (Oh and everyone in the Mater Hospital X-ray department). The reason for coming home? Well Christmas is one thing but our Becks' 21st Birthday had a big part to play. After the long journey home (now revised to about 34 hours not the previously advertised 36 hours) I landed in Dublin on Friday afternoon and met up with Edel in Jim Beams Bar (yes that's what it is called Mark, Jim Beam). We were quite lucky to miss Becky who was getting the bus back to Monaghan at the same time. 
> We really were lucky. If I'd been just about 20 or 30 minutes late then I would probably have bumped into Becky walking down the road towards the flat. As it was it worked out well. I can't remember if I walked around town for a bit or if I just went straight to the flat. Either way we made sure that Becky had got the bus and the flat was free.

So after resting up in the flat for a while we went drinking with all of Edels workmates where I proceeded to fall asleep in the pub, it was all good though and the Guinness tasted great! Saturday we went home on the bus and started plotting how we could surprise everyone.
> When we got back to Monaghan we had to make sure that Edel wouldn't be collected by Dad so we made up this story that she was meeting our friend Paul for a drink and that she'd get a taxi home. This meant that I could surprise everyone and that nobody would come looking for Edel. So we waited in the Pig and had a drink, just enough time for everyone to be at home.

So Edel went into the house first and gathered everyone in the Kitchen while I waited outside. Then we both went in and surprised everyone. What a great feeling! Of course Becks was at work so there was some more surprising to do. We had to wait till she got home at 12 and I hid in the dining room. Then when everyone was in the kitchen out I popped to surprise Becky. We all knew she'd have the biggest reaction and she didn't disappoint!
> I have to say that this was without doubt, one of the best nights of my life. To finally get home after a long trip and to see everyone's reactions was brilliant. I'd recommend the surprise return home to anyone!

The next day it was time to surprise the guys in Game. Adam already knew I was coming home but he was still surprised when I rang him. Plus we got to surprise Michelle in the flat. Then it was in to the shop to say hello to everyone there and to catch up with the gossip. Much success, although I've yet to hear the goss from the staff party!
> The staff party was on the night that I arrived home so I wasn't able to surprise the GAME gang that night. They has the party up in Adams flat, pizza and beers as it turned out, and then went out drinking.

Adam invited me over to his house so that we could surprise his Mum and Dad along with Jade and Sean. I hid in the back of the car while Adam got them to come out so that I could make my appearance. I don't think Adam realised how embarrassing that day would be though.
> I'll let Adam tell you that story.

So this weekend it'll be a chance to catch up with everyone I haven't seen yet, plus it's Becks' Birthday on Saturday so I'm sure I'll be out and about. Back to Oz before the New Year with Edel so that should be good fun, she can finally meet our Oz family.

Surprise,
Paddy.
