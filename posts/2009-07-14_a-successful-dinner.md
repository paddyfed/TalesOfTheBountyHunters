So I finally made dinner for Paula, my spaghetti bolognaise, and it went down a treat! It was the first time I'd made it with meat pieces in a long time but it worked out well. That night we were playing an eleven-a-side game at Gortikeegan for the first time. We did lose the game but it was a great experience all the same. My left toe will never be the same again though. That night we went out for a few drinks with some of the GAME crew and Nicola Sherry came back to the flat for a tour.

On Friday night we went out for drinks in McKennas again, this time it was Me, Adam, Shelly, Marc, Grace and Jade. We sat around for a good while before heading back to the flat to play a bit of Rock Band. We were out again on Saturday this time it was Me, Paula, Martina and Michael Quinn. We headed to the Pig and met up with Landers as it was Rachels 21st Birthday. We then all headed to the Seasons and thankfully we all got in too! Paula came back to the flat that night as she was working the next day.

I went out home for my dinner on Sunday too but I didn't get to stay too long. Edel was up and Mum and Dad had to drive her back to Dublin. I did give the "Walk with Me" DS game to them and they really liked it too. On Monday it was Brian McGonnell's anniversary. I was working until half six and Paula came in to collect me. That meant we were a bit late for the mass. We all went back to Patricia's house for a bite to eat. On Tuesday I was tired at work all day and really didn't want to play football. But never mind that we actually played for two hours, one with Ben and his mates and one with our regular crowd. I enjoyed the first match better but I was absolutely wrecked after it. I don't think I'll be doing that again in a hurry!

Paddy.
