On Tuesday morning I got up and was heading down to Dublin for work again. Of course this time I decide to miss the first bus just to make things exciting. So a quick walk around to the bus station and I was on my way. We were staying in the same hotel so at least I knew where to go. I had to stop off at the shop to get a key for the room and got changed back at the hotel so I ended up being a bit late but it was grand. I finished up late that night too and it was a bit annoying trying to get up to the room with only one key.

Wednesday was another long day at work but thankfully we were finished up early. Paula was visiting a few meat factories during the day and apparently they were a bit horrific, she was telling me this over the phone and while we were talking she got word that baby Layla was born. 9lb 2oz and nearly 12 hours in labour I think, so it was quite a struggle. On Thursday we had a huge delivery in work, we received all of our 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2' in one go! So we spent most of the day trying to sort that all out and for the first time we didn't have any discrepancies! On Friday Adam was heading home so I was closing the shop and had the hotel room all to myself. I took a few photos of the room as I definitely wasn't coming back for another week!

So Saturday I booked out of the hotel and headed to work, thankfully this time I knew what bus to get and didn't miss it. Paula came over to the flat too as she was heading out with her bank friends. I on the other hand was heading out with Brian, Marie, Mark and Sara. We started off in the West for a few but quickly moved to the Poc to [watch the boxing](http://www.rte.ie/sport/boxing/2009/1108/hayed_valuev.html) although it wasn't that exciting. We then decided to head to the Seasons for some strange reason but we did get to meet up with Paula in the end. We headed home in the early hours of the morning just a little bit drunk.

Sunday was a bit bad. Although I didn't really feel like I had a hangover we didn't get up any time early! We did want to go to the cinema to see 'Up!' and Paula went and got us some dinner. Although when I did get up to eat I just didn't feel well. I didn't actually get sick but I wasn't able to eat anything. So we headed out to Paula's house and watched a DVD instead.
