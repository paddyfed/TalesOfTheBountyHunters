Lets just say that I didn't have a great start to the week as I was already fed up and wanted to head off as soon as possible. No real reason behind it I just didn't want to be working! At least it went quickly and Thursday came around. Paula came back from college and had dinner ready for me in the flat! We ate that and then headed down to Dundalk for a night out. We were in Brubakers for drinks and then headed to Ridleys night club. Paula met a few of her classmates and we were even talking to Orla Landers who was out celebrating her classmate winning the student elections. We booked ourselves in to the Crowne Plaza hotel for the night.

Friday morning Paula was up early to go to college. I, on the other hand, stayed in bed. When she got back we headed off but I wasn't feeling the best. We headed in the direction of Newry and we thankfully got a flat tyre. I say thankfully because it sobered me up trying to fix it. Eventually we got to Newry and did all of our shopping for the week. We made dinner when we got back to the house and then we headed on to Fanad. We arrived late so we just headed straight to bed.

Saturday we got up and went for a few walks on the beaches. We also drove over to Doagh Beg and showed Paula the beach we used to go to when we were young. I never thought I'd get to show someone the beach that I loved when I was so young. We headed back to the house after that and made dinner and watched the Premiership. We went to the Atlantic House for a few drinks in the evening and to meet the locals. The guy who was playing the music was good too and even his jokes weren't that bad. Everyone was really friendly too and we even got a free drink as Paula chose a winning raffle ticket for the people sitting next to us. They even offered us a lift home too!

On Sunday we got up late, as we had one hour less due to the clock change, and we had steak for dinner. We also watched the [Monaghan match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0328/mayo_monaghan.html) and then headed to the pier to try to watch the boats come in. Unfortunately we were a bit late but we headed on to Letterkenny to see 'Kickass' in the cinema.

On Monday the weather took a turn for the worse so we couldn't go for any walks like we planned. We did go for a drive though, all round Fanad Head and even as far as Carrigart and Creeslough over the Harry Blaney bridge. We got home eventually and watched 'Team America' on DVD and listened to the wind howling outside.

When we got up on Tuesday the weather hadn't improved and we heard reports that it was even worse near home so we decided to cut our losses and head back. We made dinner and then packed up and thankfully it didn't take us too long nor did we have any hassles getting back. When we got back the [Bayern Munich and United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0330/bayern_manutd.html) was just starting so we watched that and then played The Sims for the evening.

So I was woken up by the girls this morning and we spent the day playing around with them and James who is taking a good few steps now. Elaine was home too and she brought home hula-hoops for the girls. We had dinner in the evening and organised our trip down to Killarney for the All-Ireland again. Hopefully Gerard can do it again! Paula then left me in to the flat and I helped her with her product recall assignment while we watched the [Arsenal and Barcelona match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0331/arsenal_barcelona1.html). So all in all it was a great holiday even if it was cut short and we'll definitely head back at some point in the future!

Paddy.
