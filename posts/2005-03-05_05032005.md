So it's been a month since I've updated which is bad cause now I can't really remember all that's happened since. I did get my new graphics card and I'm really pleased with it because 'The Sims 2' and 'Medal of Honor' work really well under it.

I'm getting a week off from work the week after next which includes Paddy's day so I think I'll be goin out that night.

There's an 18th that I'm going to tonight which should be good craic. I haven't been out since the 21st that I was at three weeks ago which was all right. Having no work tomorrow helps though. There's also another 21st next weekend and a good friend of mine is coming down from Donegal to go to it. That should be mental craic cause there's always a good night when I'm out with him.
