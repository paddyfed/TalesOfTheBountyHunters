Saturday: Paula picked me up around 11 and we headed down to Dublin. She went to Hairspray in the Grand Canal theatre with her ones and I walked around town for the day. I bought the Clone Wars season 2 on DVD and a new Star Wars calendar. I went back to the flat and then went to meet Paula and we got a Chinese on the way back. We watched the [Ireland v New Zealand match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2010/1120/ireland_newzealand_report.html) and we went to the cinema to see Due Date which was very good.

Sunday: We were up around 1 and headed down town. Paula bought herself a new dress, some books for Pauric, new runners and we got hot chocolate from Starbucks. We bought food in Tesco and we went back home and made dinner at Paulas house. She left me home as I had an interview in the morning but I didn’t tell her that. Mum still wasn’t feeling great and I’ll probably go to see her tomorrow.

Monday: I was up around 9 and got a taxi to town. I had an interview with Computershare at 10 and it went well, I was there for around 45 minutes. I walked into town and was working at 1. I went to Cavan to visit Mum after work and she was feeling a bit better but still looked very pale and weak. They’re waiting on test results but she could still be in for a while longer.

Tuesday: I wasn't up too early and Paula finished up work early too. She came over to the house and I had left a few notes in the house for her. We headed to Dublin and made dinner there. We were going to the Olympia to see Ross Noble and we were only about three or four rows from the front. Mark, Sarah and Sarahs house-mate came along too and it was very funny. We went for a drink in 'The Foggy Dew' and then went back to the flat.

Wednesday: We were up around 12 and went down town and we walked around the shops for ages. I bought the Trivial Pursuit and I bought my secret Santa present for Ben in work, it was a Batman comic and poster, and I bought some dessert forks for Sean and Margaret. We got food and headed back to the flat to make it. We then went down the road and visited Mum in Cavan.

Thursday: Paula brought me home in the morning and I was in work all day. I went straight to football and although it was a 5 vs 4 match it was still pretty close if not fantastic. I even scored a few goals too. I got back home and made dinner only to throw half of it in the sink. Paula went for a massage on her back today but she was a bit upset when she heard that Ted's balance was being affected. I didn’t get a chance to talk to her though as we were tidying the house for Mum coming home tomorrow.

Friday: Mum wasn't able to come home and I was in work until half six. I then went to Paulas house and it had been snowing so the roads weren't great. We were at the anniversary mass and then out to Ted and Eileens for tea. We sat around and watched the toy show and then headed back to Paulas house.

Paddy.
