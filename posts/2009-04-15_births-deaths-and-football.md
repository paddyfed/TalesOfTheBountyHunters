On Sunday I went home for dinner, it being Easter Sunday and all. Edel and Becks were up too so it was a nice big family meal. Edel made her lovely muffins too! We also went driving in Vince for a bit around Tyholland chapel and that car is a lot easier to drive than Elizabeth ever was! We had planned to go out that night but Paula's neighbour, Mrs Kelly, had died during the day so she spent the day at her house helping out. I hitched a lift in with the girls as they were heading into the Poc for a few drinks.

Monday I was in the flat for most of the day but I did head home for my dinner. Paula then came out to the house and we stayed for a while. We headed back to the flat and Paula decided to stay over as she was working early the next day.

Tuesday it was the return matches in the Champions League as [Chelsea and Liverpool](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0414/chelsea_liverpool.html) played out the most amazing game of football ever! It was really nerve wrecking stuff as the advantage swung one way then the other throughout the whole match. Chelsea eventually went through.

And on Wednesday we went out to the Pig to watch the [Porto vs United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0415/porto_manunited.html) and although it wasn't as entertaining as the previous match Ronaldo's wonder goal more than made up for it. United then became the first English team to beat Porto at home and progressed to the next round.

Also while I was at work Paula text me to say that Caroline had wee baby James Bernard at about quarter to five in the afternoon. Maybe he'll be a United supporter???

This weekend we're heading to Killarney to the Scór final so that'll be fun.

Paddy.
