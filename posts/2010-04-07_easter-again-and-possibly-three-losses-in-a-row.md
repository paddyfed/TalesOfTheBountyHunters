So on Thursday Paula came over to the flat and we went around town looking for  Monaghan away jersey but we didn't have any luck. She wants one for when we go away to the Scor at the end of April but it's not looking likely at the moment. I headed to football in the evening and got a lift back to Paulas with Ger.

Friday I was out in Paulas all day. I had no work as it was Good Friday and while everyone went to Mass I sat and played The Sims 2 on the laptop. I also thought that there were a couple of guys trying to rob stuff out of the cars at Glennan but it turned out to be the cops in the end.

On Saturday I got a lift back into the flat and headed to the Pig to watch the [United and Chelsea match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0403/manutd_chelsea.html). A draw would've been a fair result but you couldn't say that United deserved to win anyway. I headed home to go to Mass that night and Edel and I headed out to meet Gavin and Sorcha. We were in the Poc and the Pig for a few and we tried to go to the Lost and Found but it was closed down! We headed to Seamies instead and ended up staying until seven in the morning. Edel and I headed to the flat and eventually got to sleep at eight in the morning.

Eventually we had to get up and we got a lift back home for our dinner. We also had a quick nap and Paula and Elaine picked me up to head back to town. We met Caroline and Kevin in the Poc but we didn't stay too long. Instead we headed to Deerys and Steph, Adam and Ger were all there too. We went to the nightclub downstairs and met up with Ciara too and even took Gavin's sister home. Edel and Karen were out too but we weren't really talking to them. Eventually we got back to the flat!

We weren't up too early on Monday either as I wasn't working so we headed out to Paulas house for the day. We also went to football in Ballinode as Gortikeegan was closed. I headed back to the flat though and had a Montie for dinner. I was back to work on Tuesday and went straight to football after it and played for two hours! One with Ben and his mates and another with the Kellys. [Barcelona also knocked out Arsenal in the Champions League](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0406/barcelona_arsenal.html) too so it was a good night.

I was working this morning too and it was busy enough. Paula is coming over soon too and we're going for a walk and then to watch the United and Bayern match!

Paddy.
