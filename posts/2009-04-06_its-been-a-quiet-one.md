Yep a relatively quiet week this time. Work was boring as usual and we spent all day on Monday setting up Fifa 09 matches. Ireland would beat Italy by 4 goals to 1 by the way. I did finally get my health insurance sorted out. That'll start going out on the 15th of every month. On Wednesday we heard that Tommy Bowe was having a bit of a homecoming in the Hillgrove so we went along to that after work. It was quite good, a lot of talking involved, but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't bring the trophies with him. We stayed in the Hillgrove for the first half of the [Ireland vs Italy match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0401/italy_republic.html). We went back to the flat for the second half though. It was an improved performance by Ireland but they're still not playing that well.

On Thursday I did a bit of work on the websites and I've started to learn how to use Dreamweaver a bit more. Friday Paula came over for a Chinese after work and on Saturday I spent the day colecting money for Down Syndrome Ireland with Ashley, Adam and Shelly. We spent the most of the day at the traffic lights before we were stopped and we also did a raffle for a DSi which Dad won! Paula came over to the flat after work to get changed as she was heading out with Ciara.

Sunday I went home for dinner again and this time Charlotte was home for a visit. I also spent most of my time trying to get updates from the [United vs Villa match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0405/manchesterunited_astonvilla.html). Hopefully the result will put us back on track!

Paddy.
