So we survived the skydiving then. It was brilliant but it's hard to describe the feeling. It's such a rush and your brain can't really process what's happening. Then the parachute opens and you can really appreciate the view. We got the DVD's so we'll hopefully be able to show it to you someday.



> Well here it is. My skydive video. Still can't describe what the feeling is like. I suppose its a mixture of terror, excitement and sheer adrenaline. Really great feeling though. I'd probably go again sometime in the future.

We went out on Saturday night too. The lady we're renting the house from was having a going away party in the house with all her mad friends. We then went into town to meet up with the guys we met in Sydney.

> This was Pedro and the gang who were up for a mad weekend in Cairns. This was a really good night out. We ended up in the Woolshed again and later went climbing on the children's play area outside the pub. Happy days.

Thankfully they weren't as crazy this time round. Next week we're going white water rafting which, as some of you may have already guessed, worries me more than the skydiving did. So hopefully we won't drown.

Smell you later,
Paddy.
