So I guess the Paddy's day celebrations are well and truly over. Monday we went out to the 'Cock and Bull' which was packed! We went down at about 9 and the girls came down about half an hour later. It was so busy that we were buying two rounds at a time. We left there at about 2 and made our way to the cross. We eventually got home at about 4, not before taking a heap of photos, many of which will probably not see the light of day! So that was our Paddy's Day celebrations and thankfully we made sure that we had Tuesday off work! We didn't move much that day but we did go down to the Tea Gardens for Yvonne and Kat's last night out. And there were a good few stories coming out of that. Yvonne finally got off yesterday and Kat will be leaving later today. We don't know what we'll do without them, we wont be having any fun, that's for sure :P . So that's the craic for now. Heading into the long weekend with a few plans but nothing definite. Palm Beach, the Easter Festival and drinking have all been mentioned and, of course the big lad's getting a year older next week. My they grow up so fast.

84 days left, 1 year older,
Paddy.
