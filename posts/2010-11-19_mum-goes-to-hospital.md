Saturday: We got up and did the messages in Emyvale and we went to town to get a few things for Elaines ‘party’. We came back to the house and watched a bit of the [Ireland and Samoa match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2010/1113/ireland_samoa.html). Paula got ready and we went to town for a Chinese. We ate it at home and waited for Emma to get ready. We went to the Poc first where there were some very drunk people, then to the Pig for some cocktails and finally to Deerys for the rest of the night. Sean and Edel were down and it was a good night out. We got a taxi straight away even though they charged us double and we went straight to bed. Paula was in Edels bed and I fell asleep.

Sunday: I was in work all day and I was in a really foul mood. I got home and ate my dinner and went to bed to talk to Paula on the phone about life and how shit it was. I told her about the technical test and that I had been feeling a bit crap over the last few days. Thankfully she was able to cheer me up a bit. I fell asleep around eleven and woke up again at three in the morning. [Sebastian Vettel won the drivers championship](http://www.rte.eu/sport/motorsport/2010/1114/abudhabi_vettels.html).

Monday: I was working in the morning and got a lift back home as some MOTUC figures were out today. I ordered King Grayskul and the weapons pack and Grizzlor was the monthly figure. I hung up the extension lead to the desk and tidied up the cables which had been annoying me. I still have to trim the screws though. Also I changed the router in the room to the old d-link one which kept dropping the internet connection. Because it’s working just as a router it should be OK. Paula then brought me to her house for football which ended up being a very good match even if we did lose in the end.

Tuesday: Working until 2, mum gave me a lift home and Paula picked me up and we went out to her house for dinner. It was meant to be a chill out evening but Paula was busy helping her mum to get ready for the cards tomorrow night.

Wednesday: Working until 2 but walked around town for a while. I bought new football socks and a diary for 2011. Paula picked me up and we went for a jog round the track. Back home Sean was playing cards but we went to bed early. I fell asleep straight away.

Thursday: I got a lift back to the house and it seemed empty. Mum had to go to hospital with a sore stomach. I got a taxi to work and was going to play football in the evening but I decided to go home and make dinner for everyone instead. Paula came over too and we watched a bit of Mighty Boosh.

Friday: I was up around 12 and Dad said that Mum was to have an operation today on a perforated small intestine. Edel came home too and Paula picked me up from work and we had curry for dinner. We went out to Paurics for a visit and watched a bit of darts. I headed home after that and the girls and Karen were watching Love Actually on DVD. I had a go at setting up the Rock Band drums but I’d actually forgotten the kick pedal.

Paddy.
