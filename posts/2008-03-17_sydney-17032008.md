Well!!! What a weekend!!! As you all know it's Paddy's Day today so this weekend was all about celebrating that and saying goodbye to Yvonne and Kat who are leaving this week. Friday night we went out to the 'Cock and Bull' to meet up with the girls but it was a bit quiet so we went to the 'Tea Gardens'. Didn't plan to get that drunk but Kat, Mary and I ended up in 'O'Malley's' in the cross and we stayed there until about 4 in the morning! Oh yea, apparently Kat and I are the cutest couple in the world! Although Elaine thinks otherwise!
> That night was so funny. We went to O'Malley's thinking that the whole gang would follow but nobody else seemed interested. We sat drinking for ages again and started dancing to any music that came on. Eventually this American woman came up to us and said that Kat and I were the cutest couple that she ever saw. Sure I couldn't argue with that.

Anyway on to Saturday and we actually went to Bondi Beach for the first time and it was actually very good. The lads were going to go surfing but there were hardly any waves so they went body boarding instead.
> I actually did a bit of body boarding myself but as you can imagine I didn't go out too far.

That night we went out for an Indian with Kat, Yvonne and Lauren, our traditional leaving gesture :P . We then went into town to the Cargo Bar (and we actually got in this time) and then to 'Home' (Sweets was very happy about this). We didn't go to watch the Rugby this time and It's obvious that we [didn't miss much anyway](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2008/0315/england_ireland1.html). (Can't bloody believe that [Wales have a second Grand Slam](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2008/0315/wales_france.html)!!!). We got home at about 4 but not before walking to Kings Cross just to find a Kebab shop! (yes Mark that's why we walked there!!!).
> We don't really know why we walked out to Kings Cross. Yes we did find a kebab shop but I think it was an attempt to keep drinking or maybe to try to find a taxi home.

So then on to Sunday and we did plan to go and watch the parade but we got there too late. So we sat drinking in Hyde Park and generally acting the maggot. Did manage to meet up with Gemma for a brief hello. We then went up to the Mercantile and stayed there for the rest of the night. Lots of drinking, jumping about, sweating, playing with the Frisbee, air guitar and spilling drink.

This night out in the Mercantile was probably the best night I had out in Australia. Everyone was just in such a good mood and the music was great. It was so warm and sweaty but nobody cared and we drank until we had to go home. The whole day was just fantastic and I would love to head back for another Paddy's day in Australia.

So now I'm at work, trying to look like I'm doing some work! Out again tonight and Tuesday for the girls final send off so we're still not finished yet.

87 days left (and not much liver left either),
Paddy.
