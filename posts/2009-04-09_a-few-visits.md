Paula is off college this week so we've been spending a bit more time together than we usually would. On Monday she came over to the flat and we watched 'Hot Shots' which was hilarious as always. Paula really enjoyed it too as that kind of silly humour movie is what she likes. I'll have to introduce her to Airplane parts one and two then.

Tuesday night Adam and I went over to Johnnys new house to watch the [United vs Porto match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0407/manunited_porto.html) in the Champions League. Ashley and Ger were there too and although it was an interesting match United really didn't play well and were lucky enough to get away with a draw.

Wednesday night we watched the [Liverpool vs Chelsea match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0408/liverpoolfc_chelsea.html) in the flat and that was a really entertaining match. It also helped that I really wanted Chelsea to win. Paula came over after work but she wasn't feeling great so she didn't stay long. She thinks she's coming down with a cold.

Thursday I played football for the first time since hurting my ankle and it went alright. I wasn't really able to run as I wasn't that fit after being out for so long but I did manage to score a few goals. Paula again came over to the flat after work and we watched a few episodes of the Simpsons.

Today I was at work but that was the height of what I've done. I know it was Good Friday and all that but I did try not to eat meat, though there were no cheese pizzas left so I'm thinking everyone else had the same idea.

Paddy.
