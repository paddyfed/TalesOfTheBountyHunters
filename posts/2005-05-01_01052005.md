Well it's the first of May and this year is flying so far. That means there's only 18 days until Episode III is released. It's going to be a bit hectic coming up to the 19th cause I'll be working the Sunday beforehand so I'll probably have to get the bus straight from work. I haven't decided yet though.

I just finished Grand Theft Auto III on Thursday. It didn't take me too long to finish it but I haven't completed all the side missions or found even a quarter of the hidden packages. Now it's on to Vice City.
