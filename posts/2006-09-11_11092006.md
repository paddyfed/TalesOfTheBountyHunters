Was up in Letterkenny again for Bird's birthday. It was a good weekend. We started off in Voodoo (used to be the Mono) on Thursday night and got hammered drunk. Was so sick the next day too much to every ones amusement. That night we ended up in Voodoo again where I had to go back to Reynolds house to get another shirt because I wasn't allowed to have my Monaghan shirt on. We then went to McCaffreys where I haven't been in a long time and met up with Dave Kelly from college. We then spent the rest of the night in the grill and we surprisingly had a good night of it. The next night we started off in the Orchard and from what I remember we went to Milan but my memory's a bit hazy after that.
