![Mario and Darren](/images/20080228_193553.jpg "Mario, my manager and Darren my team leader")

No real news today, I just wanted to write a blog entry on the leap day. Watch out for those wedding proposals guys!!! Well the only real news is that we saw Rambo in the cinema on Tuesday. It's not too bad but it is just a big blood and gore fest with hardly a hint of a plot but you can't expect much more from it can you? Last night was my bosses leaving party (he's going due to the merger) so that was a lot of fun especially the skit that they did of the weekly staff meetings.
> It was quite sad that Mario had to go. He was a great guy and he was easy to talk to and have a good laugh with. Which really could be said for the most of the guys in Peoplebank. After the merger there were a lot more people and it was harder to get to know anyone really well but I'll always fondly remember the craic we had in the Sydney office.

That's really all for now, hopefully the weekend weather is good and we can go to the beach or something.

104 days left,
Paddy.
