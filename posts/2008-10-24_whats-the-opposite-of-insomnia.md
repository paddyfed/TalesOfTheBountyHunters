Most people who know me know that I enjoy a good lie in. Whenever I get the chance I just lie in bed for a few hours over what I would normally get up. For example, if I usually had to get up during the week for nine in the morning, at the weekends I would usually get up at around twelve or maybe one o'clock. That's fine, I hear you say, nothing wrong with a weekend lie in. However the problem arises when I am off work for any extended period of time, like holidays or more recently my extended unemployment. What happens is I start to lie in for longer periods and therefore am not tired at the more traditional times of night. So I start staying up longer at nights until eventually I start getting up in the late evenings, say seven or even eight o'clock, and I would actually go to bed in the early morning, around six or seven when it's starting to get bright.

The problem with this is that when you actually have to get up at a reasonable time you're usually exhausted for the whole day and start to flake out at about four in the evening. So I'm trying to get back on track by trying to get up a bit earlier every day until I'm back in a more regular pattern. To help me with this I think I'll start to develop a few websites. Giving myself a project to do will hopefully motivate me to get up and do a bit of work. Plus it might actually help me to get a job. I may even move the blog over to a dedicated website if I can manage it.

The other day I went out to Adam's house to watch the match (United were convincing 3-0 winners over Celtic, despite the two 'offside' goals from Berbatov) and this is where my sleep pattern was messed up. I was already up that day to collect my wages so I was already outside my usual pattern. I went out at around six, when I'd usually be getting up, and we watched the match with a few beers at half seven. After that we played the air hockey game on the Wii, which is a great mini game by  the way, until about eleven that night. Now everyone was heading to bed so I went too. I was a bit tired and I did sleep a bit, until about half three. After that though I was wide awake so I lay there, sometimes messing with my phone. When everybody was getting up that's when I started to feel tired again and so when I got home, I went straight to bed and didn't get up till about seven that evening.

It'll probably be sometime next week that I'll be able to change things though.
