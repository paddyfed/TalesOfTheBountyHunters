All going to plan this will be my last blog entry from Cairns as I'm moving down to Sydney tomorrow morning. It's so I can get a job down there as soon as possible and hopefully it'll be easier when I get down there.
> I would've definitely had the job interview with GAME at this stage. The guy doing the interview said he would help me out with getting a job in one of the Sydney stores but he never did anything so feck him anyway!

The lads will be staying up here for a few more weeks and we'll be meeting up at the Melbourne cup at the start of November. The last weekend in Cairns was another quiet one. We did go into the Lagoon in the city on Sunday, finally, which was great if a bit cold.
> The Lagoon is very nice and I'd taken a load of photos there, only to realise that I'd set the quality to the worst setting so I had to start again. You did feel a bit pervy though, plus a guy was caught taking photos of people at the Lagoon just the week before so you had to be sure what you were pointing at just in case.

Oh yea and about the Rugby, is someone playing an elaborate practical joke or are England actually in the Final? I want to know because I can't find a news report that says France beat them. Help me out here! So the next time I'm on here it'll be from Sydney, taking in the sights and finding a job.

Wish me luck,
Paddy.
