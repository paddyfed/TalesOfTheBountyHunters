Still no job and I've nearly given up trying to find one up here. Well not just yet but I'm getting a bit fed up. This weekend we did have Dawn up with us, one of the guys we stayed with in Sydney for a few days. That was cool, they all went scuba diving on the reef and they all enjoyed it. Plus we had a BBQ on Friday then a dip in the hot tub. This backpacking is tough.![Dawn and Landers in the Woolshed](/images/P8190095.JPG "Dawn and Landers in the Woolshed")


> Dawn was up for a few days holiday in Cairns and she was able to stay with us as Carmen had already left for her Prawn trawler. And no, that's not a euphemism , she actually was on a prawn trawler. The first night she was up we met her in PJ's and a wole host of people decided to come in at the same time for a meal, some of whom decided to sit with us. Exciting times.

Oh yea and we actually met up with a guy, Steve Beek, that we met in Bangkok of all places. He was on a trip all over Europe and Asia and was finishing up in Brisbane. We never expected to meet him up here but he was up for a few days before going back down. Mad fella but sound.
> We planned to meet up with Steve if we were ever in Brisbane again. Although the lads did eventually make it down there, I headed on straight to Sydney so never did get the chance to meet up. Maybe someday in the future.

There's not much else to report. Going to see Powderfinger and Silverchair in October I think and then the Killers in November so something to look forward to.

Rock on,
Paddy.
