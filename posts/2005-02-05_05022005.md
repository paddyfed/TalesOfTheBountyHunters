There's nearly 100 days left until "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" is released. The 19th of May has been confirmed as the release date in the UK which I suppose means Ireland as well. I still don't know what to do for the release. I don't want to see it in my local cinema because, basically, it's crap. I would love to go over to a premier in London maybe but it's organising the trip that I couldn't be bothered with. I'll have to do something for the last Star Wars movie to be released though!

I'm going to get a new graphics card for the PC, an ATI Radeon 9800. I know it's probably not the best graphics card on the market but it's within my budget and it's better than my current Hercules 3D Prophet.
