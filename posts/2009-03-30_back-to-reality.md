So it was back to work this week and there wasn't much to tell really. I bought a few Star Wars mini figures for a Euro and I'll probably be able to sell them on e-bay at some stage. For the most part we either played Mad Tracks on the 360 or watched South Park in the evening. I did get an email back from Compuserve about the CV I sent in. They want to see a few examples of website that I'd developed so I'll have to get them in gear.

Went to see Slumdog Millionaire in the cinema with Paula too. It's actually very good which surprised me as I thought it would be one of those disappointing movies that just happen to get a lot of support around Oscar time. I would definitely watch it again.

Friday night we went to McKennas to see Ben and his band play. It was Me, Paula, Adam and Shelly and we stayed and had a few drinks. I didn't manage to get talking to Seamie though which was disappointing. The bands were quite good too which was a plus. Paula decided to stay in the flat too and Adam and Shelly went back to Shelly's house. This was also the first night that I had ever told Paula that I loved her. Thankfully she said the same.

On Saturday Brian and Bird were down so we went out to watch the [Ireland match against Bulgaria](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0328/ireland_bulgaria.html). We watched the first half in the Pig but moved to the Poc for the second half and we managed to get a seat. It was a really disappointing match though. Paula had to work though, in fact she thought she had got a parking ticket before she left but thankfully she didn't. We stayed in the Poc for the night and we were joined by Landers and Sara. I did get quite drunk though!

On Sunday Marie was in the Shopping Centre final thing and she was very close to winning the &#8364;2000 prize but unfortunately lost out at the last post. I nearly missed the thing too as it was over very quickly. After that I went home for dinner and we had pancakes in the evening which was a bit of a blast from the past.

Paddy.
