So I wasn't working on Friday and so I lazed in the flat all day. Paula finished up in college early so she came around to hang out for a while. I then got ready to go and we headed out to her house so that she could get ready too. We then headed out home and drove down the road to Ballymena for Denis' 50th party. We were up there for a good while and thankfully nobody was taking the piss, well not too much anyway although I did like Barneys 'watch out for his Da' comment. We headed home around three in the morning and headed straight to bed.

We didn't get up too early on Saturday. Paulas back was really sore too. She did leave me out to Adams house though so that we could watch the [Ireland and Italy match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0206/ireland_italy1.html). It wasn't a great match, especially the second half, but it was the right result. We also watched the [England and Wales match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0206/england_wales.html) after that and played Rock Band for the rest of the evening.

On Sunday it was Laylas Christening so we all headed to Scotstown for that. They were all going for their dinner in the West but I was heading home for my dinner anyway so I just went to the flat. [Superbowl XLIV](http://www.rte.ie/sport/other/2010/0208/neworleanssaints_indianapoliscolts.html) was on that night too so Mum and I sat up and watched that. It wasn't the most exciting game, especially compared to the [previous years](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/02/stock-takes-injuries-and-laughs.html), but it was still a good match. The Saints finally won a Superbowl too!

Today I only got up at around three and I just headed back to the flat. Adora arrived during the week so I took her home, the collection is now at 14 figures! I'm heading to football in a while too but it's back to work tomorrow!

Paddy.
