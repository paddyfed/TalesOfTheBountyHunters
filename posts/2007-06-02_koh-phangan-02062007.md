So we're still on the Island but it's our last night. The 'Full Moon' party was class, just try to imagine a huge disco on a beach with thousands of people and it never ends.

> It literally never ends. When we were leaving that morning it was still going, didn't look like stopping at all. I remember hearing that they usually go on for a few days after the full moon.

We left the bungalow at about seven on Friday and we didn't land back until nine o'clock on Saturday morning.

> I remember the taxi ride back to the hotel as we started a bidding war between these two guys. I think we ended up paying over the odds anyway but we didn't care by this stage. Come to think of it I'm not even sure that it was a taxi. It could've just been some guy who gave us a lift.

Again loads of Jager to be had along with some sang som. Nice. Met some cool people too, everybody seems to be very friendly! We didn't do much on Saturday as you can imagine but today we went on the scuba diving trip. OK so I chickened out but I still had a cool time on the boat. The lads said it was fantastic craic so when we get to OZ I might give it a go then, after some swimming lessons first though!

> Never did take the swimming lessons, or do a scuba dive.

Tomorrow we leave Koh Phangan and we head to Koh Samui for another five days. Hopefully it won't be as crazy!!

Love ya's all,
Paddy.
