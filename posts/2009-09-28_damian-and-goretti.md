So on Friday night I headed out to Paulas. Nora and Eileen were up so we headed off to Wrights for a few drinks but we didn't stay that long. We got back to the house and sat watching TV for a while and fell asleep on the couch. We had to get up early on Saturday so that we could get ready. Elaine and Stephanie helped Paula to get ready and Caroline brought me over a nice purple tie to wear. We headed off at about half ten only to realise that I didn't have a battery for my camera so we had to go back into the flat and get the other camera. We eventually left Monaghan at about eleven.

We headed towards Ballybofey, getting caught behind every tractor on the way, but we made it in great time for the wedding and we didn't get lost looking for the church either! The service was really nice and it was over very quickly too. We were going to go and have a drink in Heeneys but we decided to go and book into our B&B first. We eventually found it and booked in, all the while talking to the guy that owned it, and he gave us directions to the Milford Inn, it turned out to only be a couple of three miles away! There we had a few drinks and sat down for our meal. The speeches were really good too, I especially liked Damian's recounting of the proposal. Then the food came out and it was fantastic! Although I did have a bit of indigestion but a few Rennie's  sorted that out. After that it was the evening part of the wedding and the band came out, there was about seven members altogether, and they were really good. We danced for ages, well until about half three when we got our taxi back to the B&B.

We didn't get up too early on Sunday. We missed the breakfast but we didn't care too much. We had a shower and headed back to the Milford Inn to pick up Mark's car. We sat around the hotel for a while listening to a few stories and generally being very tired. We headed back to Letterkenny and lay down on the couch for a while, I [watched a bit of the Grand Prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/0927/singaporegp.html) and Paula slept for a while. We were just about to head back to Ballybofey for another nights session when Sarah suddenly felt ill so they decided to head home. The rest of us piled into the car and headed down. We sat in Heeneys listening to the band until about one in the morning. This also included a few sing songs. We then said our goodbyes and headed back to Letterkenny, although we were fleeced by the taxi man on the way back.

So on Monday we didn't get up too early again. We did manage to get a bed though because Mark and Sarah went home so every cloud had its silver lining. We eventually got up at about two and had a fry up. Thankfully there weren't as many hung over heads today. We didn't stay too long though and we were soon on our way back to Monaghan, stopping off to get McDaid's Football Specials on the way. We got a pizza when we got back and watched Black Books for the evening. It was a really great weekend and we hope to head back up to visit the newly weds soon. Although I do think they will be down in Monaghan soon so that should be good!

Paddy.
