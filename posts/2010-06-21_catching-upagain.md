Yet again I let the blog slip a bit but I was still keeping notes so here's a round-up of the previous few weeks.

Wednesday 19th May - Today I stayed in Paulas house as we were heading to Dundalk the next day.

Thursday 20th May - Today was Paulas last exam so we headed down to Dundalk early. I walked around town for a while and bought a few clothes. Paula finished her exam and it went well and then we booked into the Crowne Plaza. We headed for a bite to eat and then went back to the hotel for a catnap. We headed to Brubakers that night and Ridleys night club. We were both very tired though so we went home early.

Friday 21st May - We asked at the hotel about staying passed the check out time and we actually got a priority card which allowed us to stay until two. We eventually got up and headed to Brigids for a table quiz in Killaney. We eventually came fourth and Paula left me back to the flat that night.

Saturday 22nd May - Today we played an eleven-a-side match in Gortakeegan. It was Monaghan McElvaneys vs Dublin McElvaneys. We ended up 5-2 winners at the end. I then went home for a barbecue before being left back to town to watch the [Champions League final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0522/bayernmunich_intermilan.html) in 3D in the Pig. We headed to Deerys after that and I stayed in the flat.

Sunday 23rd May - I headed home with Paula and the girls so that they could test Beckys new toy for her. She got some good shots of the girls and we left them back to Carolines. We headed back home for another barbecue and then back to town. McAdam was home for a few weeks so I went for a few drinks with him and met up with Ciara and Paula in the Poc.

Monday 24th May - I headed back to Paulas house after football for dinner.

Tuesday 25th May - I made a mistake with the roster in work so I went in early even though I didn't need to. It really annoyed me too but Paula came into town so I walked around the shops with her for a while. Paula headed down to Dundalk to Gertie and it all went well.

Wednesday 26th May - Paulas dress that she ordered on the Internet was supposed to arrive today but they made another mistake with the address so she went to 'Blayney herself to pick it up. To make up for it though I made her dinner in the flat.

Thursday 27th May - Paula headed to the Ulster Folk Park with Martina and they had a good day despite the bit of rain.

Friday 28th May - I headed to Paulas house after work.

Saturday 29th May - We headed home to get a lift with Mum &amp; Dad to Portstewart for their own surprise anniversary party. We had booked them into a B&amp;B for the night and we headed home late that night. It was a really lovely day and there was great craic all day in the marquee.

Sunday 30th May - We weren't up too early today and Paula headed home as she didn't feel that well. Mum &amp; Dad eventually came home too.

Monday 31st May - Paula went to the doctor and discovered that she has an inflamed chest and mild asthma.

Tuesday 1st June - Caroline picked me up from town and we headed out to Paulas house as Stephanie was having some cake for her Birthday.

Wednesday 2nd June - Paula and Becky signed on today.

Thursday 3rd June - Paula got asked for an interview in 'Blayney today and she went to Dundalk to get papers signed for the dole office. She ended up buying clothes for her interview too.

Friday 4 June - We took a spin to 'Blayney to see where Paulas interview was and we went around the shops for a while. Paula tried on a Monaghan jersey and I had to tell her that I'd already bought one for her. I gave her the present when we got back to the flat and we changed the size and then headed out to her house for a walk. I'd also bought her 'Walk With Me' on the DS so that she could track her steps.

Tuesday 8th June - Paula had her interview today and she found out a few hours later that she got the job. We headed down to Dublin for Beckys exhibition and we eventually got home around half one.

Wedesday 9th June - Paula had an appointment in the hospital today so I sat with her in the waiting room for a while but I had to go to work. She has to go back for an x-ray and some blood tests soon too. We had our stock take today and it was probably the worst ever as there was no craic and it went on far too long.

Thursday 10th June - Paula started work today and it all went well, even meeting the hens.

Friday 11th June - The World Cup started today with [South Africa v Mexico](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0611/mexico_southafrica.html) and [Uruguay v France](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0611/uruguay_france.html). I was in Paulas house for dinner today too.

Saturday 12th June - I was in Paulas all day today and I watched the [England and USA match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0612/usa_england.html) including Rob Greens blunder. After putting tan on Paula I headed to a charity ball with Gerard and felt very under-dressed. Pamela, Elanor, Shelly, Gerard and I tried to go to Deerys to meet up with the hen party but it was closed. We went back to the Seasons instead and the place was empty. Paula had a good time at the hen party but unfortunately we were back too late to see them as we went to Ted and Eileens house at four in the morning.

Sunday 13th June - I was in Paulas house today and watched a bit of the [Dublin match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0613/dublin_wexford.html) before heading home for dinner.

Monday 14th June - Football today as usual.

Tuesday 15th June - Paula had her blood tests today and she didn't feel well after it. I also ordered a few MOTUC figures today.

Wednesday 16th June - Paula collected me after work and we went to her house for dinner and just chilled out all evening.

Thursday 17th June - I went loking for 'Death at a Funeral' to watch on DVD but they didn't have it in. Paula came round to the flat after work as she finished early and we went and got the DVD. She came back round to the flat after football to watch it. She stayed the night as she wanted to be up for work in the morning and [Mexico beat France](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0617/france_mexico.html) so they could be out very soon.

Friday 18th June - Paula was up early and I lazed around the flat all day and played 'God of War'. We then headed to Glaslough for a treasure hunt and I think we ended up being third. It was great craic though. [England had a terrible result](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0618/england_algeria.html) against Algeria too.

Saturday 19th June - I spent most of the afternoon chasing Ciara and Niamh around the house with the Activity Meter. I then went to town with Paula looking for a fathers day present and we bought a bottle of whiskey for him. We went back to the house and made dinner and went to a charity auction that night. Gerard bought a '86 Maradonna shirt for â‚¬525.

Sunday 20th June - We were in Patricias house for a party and they had two bouncy castles and nearly all the kids were there. It was a really good day too and we were celebrating a few birthdays and Ashleys going away. We left at nine and went back to Paulas house.

Monday 21st June - We were up early and Paula headed to work. I didn't get up to much and have football this evening.

Paddy.
