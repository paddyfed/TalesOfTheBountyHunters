Went out on Saturday with two of my Sisters, Edel and Emma, cause it was a friend's birthday and she was heading off to Australia. We started off in the West on the third floor. It was good craic but the pints were terrible. Word of advice never get a pint up there. Go downstairs and bring it up, don't waste your money upstairs. Anyway we then moved on to the forum, staying on the second floor beside the bar. This is by far the best place to stand in the Forum because you're close to a bar that's never too busy and there's not too many people trying to get around you. After that we ended up back at Lynda's house for a few games of Twister. Class craic.
