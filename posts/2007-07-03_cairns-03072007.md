So we finally made it to Cairns. We had a short stop over in Townsville which is really a good place to go out.

> Next to Airlie Beach, Townsville was probably the best town that we stayed in, for craic anyway. We did seem to land when the schools were finished though. We reckoned that when we were in Brisbane that the school year finished and when we made it to Townsville they had finished their exams. Here we also met up with Pete's brother and it was the first time that we got pre-mixed drinks at the bar because they didn't have anything else!

Plus we had the best lasagne and chips in Molly Malone's pub where we watched Australia beat New Zealand in the tri-nations. It was a fairly good match but there seemed to be more Kiwis than Aussies there so there wasn't much celebrations. They seem to follow Rugby League here more than Union which is a bit gay. Roll on the world cup I say! After that we moved on to Cairns where we'll be staying for a while. 

> We stayed in Serpent hostel which turned out to be a good bit away from the centre of Cairns. It was quite a nice hostel though. Good and lively. Once we left it though, I don't think we ever went back to it. Not even for a nostalgia trip. Just shows how far it actually was from everything.

It's smaller than Townsville but seems to be just as lively. We think we've found a house to stay in too which will be class when we finally settle in.

All's going well,
Paddy.
