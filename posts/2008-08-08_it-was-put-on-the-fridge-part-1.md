Welcome to the first part in a semi regular (meaning not regular at all) feature of things that were put on our fridge when we were in Sydney. As you may or may not know, during our time in 8 Old South Head Road, Bondi Junction, we purchased some fridge magnet letters and wrote little messages on the fridge door every so often. So I'd like to share some of them with you. Plus it gives me an excuse to tell you that [October 2007](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007_10_01_archive.html) has been completed. Oh and I've been sorting out all the photos that I have from OZ and on my PC so I hope to have a few more up on [Bebo](http://paddy1138.bebo.com) soon. So back to the fridge. We generally put up phrases that we picked up from other sources. None more so than our first phrase...
![That's Numberwang](/images/P3010122_01.JPG "That's Numberwang")


This phrase comes from that brilliant show 'That Mitchell and Webb Look' and it first started with the lads in SMEC and quickly spread to the house. It was especially useful when you asked how much something cost. $4.50? That's Numberwang!



Classic phrase from a classic show. This was on the fridge around the 1st of March 2008.
