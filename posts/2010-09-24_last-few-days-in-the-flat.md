And now the end is near...etc.

We're on the final stretch of our time in the flat. Paula came over after work on Wednesday and I made a butter chicken curry although it wasn't as nice as the regular one. She couldn't stay long either as she was heading to her cookery class. I sat and got updates from all the Carling Cup matches that evening and [Liverpool](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0922/liverpool1.html), [Man City](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0922/westbrom_mancity.html) and [Chelsea](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0922/chelsea_newcastle.html) are all out on the one night. [United](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0922/manunited_scunthorpe.html) got through but only after an early scare.

Thursday I was working from 12 to 6 and it was a very long day! Probably because I was looking forward to getting home and making dinner for Paula. It's probably the last time we'll get to make dinner in the flat properly and it was fitting that it was spaghetti night. We then went for a walk and got a DVD out, 'I Love You Man', which was quite good.

So this morning Paula had to head to work and I tidied the house for another viewing. I'm also heading out to Paulas house for dinner and a harvest show thing that Ciara and Niamh are in. We are also having a Rock Band night on Saturday (it's BYOB & C) as a last hurrah for the flat. It's hard to believe that this time next week we'll be gone, but at least we have Bill Bailey to cheer us up!

Paddy.
