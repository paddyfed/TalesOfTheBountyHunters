So on Wednesday Paula finally got her exam results and she passed them all which was a great relief for all. My niece Charlotte was over for a visit too and we went for lunch with Mum and Dad and Patricia. I also went out home for dinner to spend time with the folks but that meant that I couldn't do anything to celebrate Paula's exam results! That was a bit crap but I guess it couldn't be helped. We spent the evening playing 'Mario Kart' between the three DS' that we have in the house.

On Thursday it was another boring day at work and I did go out to play football and managed to win. After that Paula called me and we chatted for a few hours. It was a bit awkward for a while as I was still feeling a bit guilty for not going out on Wednesday night and I was a bit of a dick by not texting or calling. Thankfully we got it sorted though and everything is good.

I wasn't working on Friday so I spent the day tidying the house. Paula was working in the evening and we went for lunch in Flemings during the day, watch out for that spilled drink though! She came over for something to eat after work too. Shelly and Jade were over in the flat while we were getting changed and I gave Jade the Star Wars magazine that I picked up for her. We then headed out to meet Ciara and her friend Louise in the Pig and we had a few drinks. We also went to the Forum and actually had a good time. I think it helped that it wasn't a really messy night though.

On Saturday we finished the bits of tidying in the flat and finally put up a few posters. We also got a few things for the party and waited for people to arrive. Ben showed up at five as he had just finished work so we started drinking fairly early and played Rock Band for the night. However we soon started getting the texts that people wouldn't be turning up. Emer did come out though so it wasn't a complete whitewash. Shelly came over with pizzas after work and Paula also came over for a while. She had been in Dublin earlier in the day at the Take That concert in Croke Park. She thought she saw Andrea at it too but she wasn't sure. So not the most successful party ever but we'll know for next time!

Sunday was a bit of a lazy day. Paula was working until five so I sat up playing Rock Band for a while. When she came over we headed to the Pig for food which was a nice change, the food was fantastic too! We then headed out to her house to watch 'Airplane' on DVD. I stayed there for the night as we weren't bothered heading back into town. Today was a lazy day too. I didn't get up until about twelve and sat around the house for a while. We went to Emyvale to get some food and then headed to town as Paula was working at five. I also managed to order the latest He-Man figure, [Hordak](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.120251400), I was very lucky too as it sold out within an hour! Apart from that I played football but didn't manage to win. It was definitely a more enjoyable game though!

Back to work tomorrow and so ends a long weekend!
