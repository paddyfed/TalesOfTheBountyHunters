Working in GAME is getting better all the time. I can actually use the tills (mostly) and I'm getting to know how things work around there.

Graduation was great, it made me realise just how much I'm missing the craic in Letterkenny and how crap it is here in Monaghan. I went out about two or three times in Monaghan over the summer and that one Friday night after graduation was better than all of them combined. My sister said she noticed it too. I don't think I'll ever get that back which makes me sad. I have loads of photos though. Someday I'll put them up on the site (when I get a good host).

The Episode III Teaser Trailer will be released on the 4th of November and I can't wait. I have Hyperspace too so I should be able to see it on the first day! I also bought the Episode I and Episode II DVD's on Wednesday. I previously said that I wouldn't buy them until after Episode III but you never know what might happen after that. They might never be available in their original form again so better to be safe than sorry.
