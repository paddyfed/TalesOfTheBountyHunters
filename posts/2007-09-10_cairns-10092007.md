This weekend we finally met up with my cousins who live out here. They invited us out to their home for an Aussie barbie. They're all really nice and they have this huge projector out the back of the house that they have hooked up to the tv. It must come in handy for the football.
> I had been in touch with my cousin, Anne, since I'd arrived in Cairns but I never went and actually met her until this weekend. And as stated in the post they were really nice and we had a good time over at their house. I remember watching a replay of the last Rugby World Cup final and hoping for a different result. I also remember that they had no cider so the lads had to endure some Aussie beer for a few hours.

That's where we went on Friday and on Saturday we made the trip to the beach at Palm Cove for a bit of a swim and a lie down.
> Palm Cove was a lovely beach. Really relaxed and nice and clean. The restaurants were a bit expensive if I remember and the lads actually had Magners for the first time in a while, even if it was $12 a bottle. Oh and this was the beach that was in a picture that was hanging in my room in Cairns, which was nice.

That night we went for a few 'quiet' ones while watching the Australia match on a big screen. We didn't manage to see the Ireland game though (but by all accounts there wasn't much to see). The pubs don't seem to be opening for the later matches plus there doesn't seem to be any commentary either.
> We watched this in the Courthouse in Cairns which is a pub that stays open really late and gets the client&#232;le to match. But at least it was open and we did go there to watch some other matches over the weeks.

Next week we'll try to see the Georgia match and hopefully it'll be a better showing. Next week we're also going to see a comedian, Arj Barker, in the civic theatre. That should be good.

Going for a 'quiet' one,
Paddy.
