[This post](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007/03/04032007.html) was the end of the old blog. I was surprised to see that I hadn't mentioned going to Australia (which was the subject of the [new blog](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/Australia)) but seeing as I hadn't told anybody about it yet I guess it's not that surprising.

There are a few things to mention that happened between this and the trip to Australia. Firstly St Patrick's Day which I spent working but then went out to Deerys to meet with Gavin, Sorcha and Edel. Next was the trip up to Belfast to Gavin and Sorcha where we watched 'Spiderman 3'in the really small cinema and went out that night. The highlight was getting egged on the way home!

Also in May was our trip over to Galway for a night out and finally our going away party in McKennas and the house party out in Marks where Pete decided to go head first into the hedge. There's too many photos of those nights to choose from so I'll leave you with this:
