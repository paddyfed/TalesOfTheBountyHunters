We went down to Dublin for the first time ever as a group and the occasion was that Landers knows someone who works in the Guinness storehouse. So we were invited down and we had a class weekend. We started off in the Porterhouse with it's fairy liquid pints of stout. We then moved onto a pub that I can't remember the name of but it was cool. There we met someone who was taller than Landers! It turned out to be a basketball player from Spain.![The lads](/images/dublin+2006+017.jpg "Us outside the Guinness Storehouse")

We then made our way to the bastard child of a nightclub that was Copperface Jacks. The next day, after a good lie-in, we went to the storehouse and went on the tour. It was cool but the free pints were better. After that we went back to the flat had some food and went back into Temple Bar. After many pints there we went to the Pod or Crawdaddy's (still don't know the real name of the place). Now that was a night club and a half. Three different areas and three different styles of dance music. After that we just wandered the streets of Dublin till we found a taxi. We'll probably do it again someday so watch this space, and next time no shoes!
