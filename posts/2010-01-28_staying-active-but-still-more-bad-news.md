Mondays football was a good one for me. Not only did I win, a rarity for me, but I also scored twice in the match. Now for most this isn't a big deal but for me who can go weeks without getting even one goal, to score two in one match is something to be celebrated. And they were no tap-ins either. The first was an interception and a slight flick past the onrushing keeper and the second was a daisy cutter from well outside the box. I was very pleased with that one!

On Tuesday in a bid to stay more active, Paula and I headed to the swimming pool for a bit of a splash. Well I splashed and Paula swam around. We did hit the steam room and sauna for a while too and next time I will remember my swimming hat! We headed back to the flat and we looked on the internet for invitations for Sean's 60th party in March. We decided that we could probably design our own for cheaper!

On Wednesday we had plans to go walking but Pamela had a problem with a USB drive of hers so I had to fix that for her. Paula instead made dinner and collected me later and I had beef stir-fry in her house. We then watched 'Jackie Brown' on DVD and got to see the [Manchester Derby highlights](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0127/manunited_mancity.html) on Match of the Day and United have another trip to Wembley this year.

Paula had a hospital appointment this morning and I had another trip to the chiropractor. Thankfully both went well and I have to go back in two weeks time for more 'fine tuning'. I was in work all day too so I couldn't go to football. I called Paula this evening too and she's a bit annoyed with her career prospects at the minute. We also heard some more bad news about Ted which really upset her. It just frustrates me that there doesn't seem to be anything I can do to help her. Plus Sean might not want to have his party now which I think is needed to cheer everyone up!

Paddy.
