Well that was an interesting day. We all went out last night as I said before because Kelly was leaving today. It was supposed to be a nice quiet few drinks (at least that was my plan) but I hadn't counted on the drinking game! Get the coin in the glass and you can choose who drinks the concoction of beer, cider, vodka, Jager and Southern Comfort. Nice. 
> We had played this game before in Melbourne and it's a great way of getting nicely toasted and it's relatively cheap, especially if you're the one buying beer and everyone else is on shorts. I wonder if I still have a 10c coin for sessions in McKenna's?

Plus because I was supposed to stay sober everyone seemed to pick on me *pauses for sympathy*. This was all down in Sidebar at the hostel. Then when it closed we decided to go to Scruffy Murphys even though it's the crappiest pub in the city. We managed to get back to the hostel at five in the morning and I had to get up at seven to go to work! So hungover for the whole day. I don't think I was much use. 
> At least I made it in though, eh?

I think we gave Kelly a good send off though. Then today the lads were house hunting again over at Bondi but nothings come up yet which wouldn't be so bad but now we have to move hostel. 
> This I think was the day that the lads saw the flat that we ended up in on Old South Head Road. They had told me that it was very small and that it wasn't finished yet and that it wasn't likely that we'd get it so we weren't holding our breath. Also I guess it was my fault that we didn't extend our stay. I had forgotten that we only booked in for a few days and that you needed to tell them to hold a room in good time. It all worked out in the end though.

'Wake Up!' is fully booked for the weekend and we forgot to extend our stay earlier this week.

Gonna get settled,
Paddy.
