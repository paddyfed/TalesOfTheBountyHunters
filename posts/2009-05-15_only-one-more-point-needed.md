It was a fairly quiet week again. Adam was back in the flat on Monday and we were in work for most of the day. I had football in the evening and made dinner when I got back. We then played 'Left 4 Dead' with Dave, Neil and Sean on-line for a while. It's the first time I played it and I was quite crap but that's to be expected. Paula had her first exam today too and it went well.

On Tuesday Adam had another doctors appointment and they told him that he needed to take another week off work so he was out of the flat again that evening! It means I'll get more hours in work but I was looking forward to having someone in the flat again. On Wednesday I went out to the Pig to watch the [Wigan and United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0513/wigan_manunited.html). United only need four points from the last three matches to clinch the title and they managed to get three that night! Not in small part to Tevez who had a fantastic match when he came on!

Paula had two more exams on Wednesday and Thursday and thankfully they went well too. She was really worried about the Thursday exam but she got through it all right and she should have done enough to pass. Played football in the rain again in Ballinode, seriously every time we go out there it's pouring. I didn't do much today outside of work. I did manage to order my [Zodac](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.118911400) figure which I was happy about although I imagine [Hordak](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.120251400) will be a nightmare to get next month. I also went to meet Paula in the Bookies and she's coming over later for another Chinese. It's getting to be a bit of a tradition.
