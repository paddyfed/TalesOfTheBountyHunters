I've been a bit busy lately and have sort of neglected the blog for the last while so this will be another long update in much the same vein as [last year](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/01/merry-christmas-and-happy-new-year.html). Thankfully this time I managed to get in before the new year!

Wednesday 16th: Paula still wasn't feeling well and she's trying to study with a bit of the flu. I was working late this evening too so we couldn't do anything. I did manage to book off some time from work so we plan to head down to Wexford for a few days.

Thursday 17th: I was working late again so I couldn't play football. Paula again trying to study with a flu. Ryan text me for the first time in ages too.

Friday 18th: Paula had her third exam today and again it went well. She came up to the flat after it and we made fajitas for dinner, they were really spicy too! She then left me out home so that I could help with the decorations but I didn't end up doing anything because Becky was home too.

Saturday 19th: I headed into work for one and I was working until 8. We had our staff party tonight too and everyone met up in the flat. We exchanged gifts, I got an R2-D2 alarm clock, and we said happy birthday to Emma. We headed to the seasons and drank in the bar and had some finger food. I got talking to Stephen Treanor too who was back for a few weeks. We then headed to the disco and Neil was really drunk and couldn't get in. We still had a good night in the night club though and we eventually got the us back into town.

Sunday 20th: I went in to work at 12.15 and stayed until 1.10! I was really hung over and wasn't doing any work so rather than being sent home I took the initiative and sent myself home! It wasn't busy at any rate and I sat up watching Big Bang Theory instead.

Monday 21st: Paula had her last exam today so now she's free for Christmas! She was going to go to Newry but the roads were too bad. There was no football in the evening either so Paula came over and we got a Chinese instead. We headed out to her house and sat in front of the TV all evening. She's really happy with all her exams and hopefully that'll translate into good results!

Tuesday 22nd: It's Becky's Birthday today so I sent her a quick text in the morning. Paula then left me back into town for work. Becky and Mum were in town too and they bought me some clothes as a Christmas present. I got two cardigans and a t-shirt. That evening Neil, Adam, the two Sherrys and I went out to McKennas for a few drinks. It wasn't anything mad just a few quiet ones. Nobody else could make it into town.

Wednesday 23rd: After work went shopping with Paula but didn't get anything. We headed out to Paulas house and made curry for dinner. We then headed back into town for a few drinks in the Pig. A few of the football guys were out and Paula's ones too. It wasn't a long night though as I had to be up early the next day.

Thursday 24th: I was working today from 7 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon and it was busy! Thankfully it wasn't too bad though. Paula, Elaine, Ciara and I went to the west for lunch and afterwords I gave Paula her present and she gave me mine. I went home after that and we all went to Mass. A poor baby a few rows in front of us decided to spew up everywhere but that was the only real event of the night. Becky did take me into town to collect my presents though and it was bitterly cold! We got back to the house and just relaxed for the evening.

Friday 25th: I got up at around twelve and the pipes were frozen! So while dad tried to fix it, Mum took me down to Emy Lough to watch the Christmas Day swim that Paula was doing. It was a bit of a surprise for her and they even had to break the ice to get in! They weren't in for long as you can imagine. After that we headed home and Ken also came over for dinner. After that we opened our presents and I got the new Ireland rugby jersey and a few Star Wars books (including the RPG!) Even the cats were getting in on the act by leaving a bird at the back door! Paula was very happy with her iPod too! We played Trivial Pursuit in the evening and everyone was really tired. Poor Edel though was feeling really miserable!

Saturday 26th: It's Emmas Birthday today. We were heading out so I got a lift back into town and Paula met me in the flat. We got ready and headed out to the Pig. It was absolutely jammed though we did get to meet up with her ones for a while. They headed to the West as we headed out to McKennas to meet Brain, Landers and Clerkin. Gavin and Sorcha were there too dressed as Marty McFly and Morph. McKennas was jammed too and I think I spent about twenty minutes at the bar! Mark went to the Seasons and we headed upstairs to hear the end of the Led Zeppelin tribute band. We headed for Pizza after that and ate it in the flat before Brian headed to get a taxi home.

Sunday 27th: It was Brian's Birthday today. We got up at about twelve and headed out to Paulas house. We were going to Anna's for dinner and there we watched a few episodes of the Inbetweeners. We then got a lift back to her house and headed into town. We got ready to go out and met up with Brian and Marie in McKennas. We stayed there for a while, and I even said hello to Gemma, and then we headed to the Poc. Becky was out too so we talked to them for a while and then Brain and Marie went to the Forum. We just went back to the flat though as I was working in the morning.

Monday 28th: So it's back to work today. I was a bit hung over but nothing serious. It was a really boring day too which didn't help! Adam wasn't about this evening either and I haven't really talked to him in ages. We're supposed to be having a New Years Rock Band party but I don't know if it's going ahead.

As this will probably be the last post of 2009 I just wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Paddy.
