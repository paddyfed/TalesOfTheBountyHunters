Welcome to my new blog. I wanted to add more stuff to my year long blog that I posted from Australia on my [Bebo Site](http://paddy1138.bebo.com) but Bebo is not the best site for blogging to so I decided to move everything over here. The original blog will still be up on Bebo but I'm not going to add anything new to it. I also found an old blog that I started soon after I finished college so I may post some of those. For now I've updated the blog entries for [May](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html), [June](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html), [July](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007_07_01_archive.html) and [August](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.html) of 2007 so feel free to look back on those. If you're wondering what that covers, it's all of Thailand, the trip up the east coast and our first few weeks in Cairns. I'll be adding posts as I go along. I plan to do a month at a time but we'll see how that goes.
> And anything in this blockquote typeface is my little 'Directors Commentary' in other words stuff that I added later. The original blog entry is in the normal typeface.

I might have more of an update next time but it's a bit late and Mum and Dad are coming back from their holiday in America this morning and I've yet to tidy the house.

Paddy.
