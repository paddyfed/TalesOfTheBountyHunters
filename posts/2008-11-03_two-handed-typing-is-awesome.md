Yes the Claw has gone finally and I'm free to use my hand again. It's still quite sore and I'm not supposed to lift very heavy things yet. Basically I have to wait another couple of weeks before trying to strengthen it up. Plus they gave me a different splint that I have to wear while in bed. This is to try and straighten out the finger. So I have to wear it for a couple of weeks and go down to Dublin for, what should be, my last physio appointment there. I've already been referred to Monaghan for other physio and I have an appointment tomorrow morning. I think this will only be the first of many trips to Monaghan General (that's if it's still open in a few weeks).

That was Wednesday and I decided to stay in Dublin that night, mainly because I was too lazy to go and get the bus. I eventually headed home on Thursday and was exhausted when I eventually got back to the house. I don't know what had me so tired but I fell asleep on the chair in the living room and went to bed at about half eleven. Friday of course was Halloween and Paula was having a family get together in her granny's house so I was invited along. Apparently the tradition is to stay in the house for a while and then head into Wrights for a few more drinks. So that's what we did. It's only the second time that I'd ever been in Wrights either. We left there at about half two and left Pamela home. Paula and I stayed up chatting in the kitchen for about an hour until Mum and Dad came home. They were up in Ballymena for the usual Haloween festivities at Denis' house.

On Saturday Brian and Bird were down for the first time in a good few weeks so we headed out to Seamies for a session. We sat around the range and young Seamie decided to let the cat out of the bag about Paula, that was a bit embarrassing but no matter. All of a sudden however it was about six in the morning and it was time to go home, everyone a bit worse for wear. I didn't get up too early on Sunday as you can imagine. I did get to watch the F1 from Brazil and it was an amazing race once again. Too bad it wasn't the result I was after and it was really hard luck on Massa. Hopefully he can do one better next year. Paula and I did manage to fit a DVD in. It was 'What Happens in Vegas' and it was quite funny. I did also get to hear the craic from the surprise party that Paula was at on Saturday night. It was for her aunt who was celebrating her 50th. Apparently wee Ciara was telling Paulas mum all about us and the fact that we had 'dirty coke' when we were babysitting last weekend.

At least that was her only concern about that night.

Paddy.
