Went out to Cavan for a night out with Michael and it was a good one. Saw this class band in a pub before moving on to a night club. The club itself was nothing special but we did have a bit of craic before taking the scenic route home. Heading out to Adam's house on Saturday to watch Ireland play England in the rugby which should be a good match.
