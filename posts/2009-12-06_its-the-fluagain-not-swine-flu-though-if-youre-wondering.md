So I was working on Friday and Paula came into the shop just around the time that I finished. We headed off to Flemings to have a bit of lunch and then headed over to the flat to chill out. Sean came over for a bit too and he was looking for some advice on buying a PC. Paula went down to work and got her final notice so the shop is closing in a week. She headed home after that and I headed out with McAdam who is actually heading back to Australia on Tuesday. We met up in the West for a few and then headed to McKennas for a few more and finally landed back in the flat for a bit of Rock Band.

I didn't get up till nearly four on Saturday and I basically lazed around the house. Paula came over again in the evening and we headed to get a Chinese. We were going to head out but it was pouring down with rain so we sat in instead and watched 'Wall-e' on Blu-Ray. It was quite late when it finished so Paula stayed the night.

She was up early on Sunday to go home for Mass and I stayed in bed for most of the day. I could feel the start of a flu coming on and I felt really bad when I went home for dinner at six. I basically vegetated in front of the TV the whole evening, not able to do anything. I did order some Star Wars soundtracks on-line for Mum though as she's sending them to some friends in England.
