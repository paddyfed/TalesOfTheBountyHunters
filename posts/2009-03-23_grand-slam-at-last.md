Finally it's happened! After so many near misses and close years Ireland have finally got what they have deserved after so many years of great rugby! We went out early to Adams house and we watched the [Fulham vs United](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0321/fulham_manutd.html) game on the computer before the match started and that didn't go down too well! I have to say that Rooney was unfairly dismissed but that cant be used as an excuse for losing the match.

Anyway after that disappointment we settled in to watch the rugby and the final match of this years six nations championship. [Ireland needed a win in Cardiff against Wales](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2009/0321/ireland.html) in order to win the Grand Slam for the first time in 61 years. The first half was a very cagey affair. Ireland had the possession and territory but couldn't get any scores. Down by six at half time we were getting very nervous.

Ireland came out all guns blazing in the second half though. Within a few minutes O'Driscoll had fashioned a try out of nothing and when Tommy Bowe went over to put Ireland up by 14 points to 6 we thought it was all over bar the shouting. Nerves then crept in as Ireland continually gave away penalties and when Jones kicked a drop-goal to put Wales up by a point we thought it would be all over. One last chance as O'Gara responded with his own drop-goal with two minutes left. There was just enough time for a bit more drama. Again Ireland gave away a penalty just on halfway and Jones stepped up to take it. He had already scored one from a similar distance in the first half and we really did think that was it. I put my head into a cushion, I couldn't watch! Adam had to leave the room the tension was so much!

We couldn't believe it though! It dropped just short and Ireland had won by two points. 15 - 17 the final score and not only had they managed to win the Triple Crown and the Championship but the coveted Grand Slam was theirs! We all leapt about the room shouting and screaming and basically going mental! It was unbelievable and it was fanastic to see them finally lift the trophy. Not only that but Bernard Dunne won his championship fight that night too.

After the match I just had to call everyone! Mum and Dad were going mad at home. Edel and Becks were celebrating in Dublin. I called Paula too and had to convince her to go out and have a good time in town and not to worry about driving people home. Thankfully she did and she had a good time. We continued drinking in the house for the rest of the evening finally finishing up on 28 cans of Guinness between the three of us.

On Sunday we went back to the flat as Adam was working and I went home for my dinner and to see Mum on Mother's Day. I also got to watch the [Irish team homecoming](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/mediaplayer.html?features,2512045,2512045,real,228) on the TV. I'd say they wont be long in bringing out the DVD for this Grand Slam winning year!
