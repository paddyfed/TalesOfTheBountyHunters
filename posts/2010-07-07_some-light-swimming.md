We did go for our walk on Monday around the track and my knee wasn't too sore. It seems to be when I'm not using it that it gets stiff and sore. Anyway we just watched a bit of TV and Paula went to bed. I sat and chatted to Gerard and Margaret for a while. Tuesday I wasn't working and Paula left me into town in the morning. I went back to bed for a while but got up and did some shopping for dinner. I made turkey supreme and we headed to the swimming pool for the first time in ages.

Today I was back at work and it went quickly. Paula didn't come over as I was going to watch the [Germany and Spain semi-final match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0707/spain_germany_worldcup.html) in the flat. It wasn't a great match but there's only a few matches left so we need to get our football fix in now. The final is on Sunday between Holland and Spain and it'll probably be another boring match. I hope not though as we are having a barbecue in Paulas house and we are planning to watch it there.

Paddy.
