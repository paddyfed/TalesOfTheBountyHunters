So Paula did come over to the flat and again she didn't have a good day at college. Though at least she now knows that she won't be going back next year. She really didn't seem to be with it though. We went shopping and she just didn't seem able to concentrate. I got a Montie for dinner and took it out to her house. Paula made herself dinner too and we sat and watched TV. We chatted all evening though about what was bothering her and what was bothering me and it was one of those serious chats that could've gone the wrong way. Thankfully it didn't though and I think we are stronger because of it.

Paula was working on Saturday though and she headed off early in the morning. At that stage I guess neither of us knew what the story was. Ger was heading to Emyvale to do the Lotto and I tagged along and we headed to Paurics to see the second half of the [City and United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0417/manchestercity_manchesterunited.html). We headed to Carolines for James party after that and played football with the kids for a while. Paula was going to come too after work but there was a strange noise coming from her car so she stayed at home. When we got back to the house Paula and I chatted and thankfully everything was alright. We headed to town to do a bit of shopping for dinner and made chicken marylands and a sweet and sour stir fry for Paula and in the mean time [Spurs did United a favour by beating Chelsea](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0417/tottenham_chelsea.html). We sat and played the Sims and watched Match of the Day for the evening.

This morning Paula was working again so she had to get up early. I caught the last of the [Chinese Grand Prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/0418/chinagp.html) and got a text from Claire in Oz looking for the pin of my old phone. Ger left me in to the flat just after twelve and that's when I updated the blog which I had neglected for the last few weeks. All caught up now though.

Paddy.
