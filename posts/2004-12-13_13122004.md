Yea I know the updates are starting to lag but that's what you get for having two jobs and no free time. I'll be leaving Club Mexx soon though (sometime in the new year) so I should have more free time then. I don't know if I'll get this web site finished in time though. It's supposed to be done before Christmas but it'll be tight. I am missing a lot of information though so I do have an excuse.

I've downloaded Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird as a replacement for the Mozilla browser that I had. Although I had a few problems configuring Thunderbird, it seems to be going all right now.

The Clone Wars DVD is officially being released on the 22nd of March next year, the day after Season 3 airs, so that's something to look forward to.
