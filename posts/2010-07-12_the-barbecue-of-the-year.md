On Thursday we did some shopping for the barbecue in Flemings with Stephanie and we got most of what we needed. Paula came over to the flat afterwards and we made a steak dinner and it was fantastic even if I do say so myself. Paula headed back home after that. I went to Tesco on Friday and bought Paula an alarm clock as she said her phone was very unreliable as an alarm. She had a doctors appointment in the evening so she picked me up from the library and headed to Emyvale. We headed back to her house for dinner then.

Saturday it was a horrible day weather wise. We got a few things ready for the barbecue. I was working from twelve to four so Paula left me into town and collected me later. That evening I watched the [third/fourth place play off](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0710/uruguay_germany1.html) while Paula headed to Patricias Fathers wake. Mairead was over too and we all sat chatting for a while and Ger, Kevin and Sean went to wrights with Chris for a few drinks.

Sunday was barbecue day and Paula was at mass in the morning. The bouncy castle and marquee were being put up when I was getting up and I played with James and the girls for a while. Eventually it was time to start the cooking and Bridget started it off but I was on cooking duty for the rest of the day. Eventually I got something to eatand the [Louth and Meath Leinster final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0711/louth_meath.html) was the main talking point. [The World Cup Final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0711/spain_netherlands.html) was on in the evening but it was a boring match just as I had predicted. Thankfully the rain stayed away and everyone had a great day. I didn't even get to sleep on the couch so I slept on Paulas floor instead.

I was back at work this evening and we had Brian's anniversary mass in Glennan. We were out at Patricias for a while too for some tea. I'm back in Paulas house tonight too and working at one tomorrow afternoon. Hopefully it will go quickly!

Paddy.
