So we went back out for drinks on Saturday. This time we met up in McKennas for a few drinks. For once the Landers clan went in early but I waited until Paula came in from work. We sat in the pub for a while and Erin was getting very drunk! Mad girl that! We then headed to the Seasons for the craic and Paula gave us a lift up. The Seasons was quite good too although we did just tend to stay beside the Sun bar all night. We also met up with Ciara which was a nice surprise. We left the lads back into town and Ciara headed home. I stayed in Paulas house that night because the rally was on right outside the flat.She left me back to the flat when she was heading to work the next day.

Sunday I went out home for dinner. Mum was in Scotland for the weekend so it was just Me, Dad and Emma. I was also getting a good dose of the flu so I wasn't feeling the best that day. I had invited Paula over to the house too as all of her family were at the [Monaghan match in Croke Park](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0426/cork_monaghan.html) but she decided not to come over as I was feeling crappy. I didn't feel much better on Monday but I did manage to get to work and play football that evening.

Tuesday and Wednesday were taken up by Champions League action. First it was [Barcelona vs Chelsea](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0428/barcelona_chelsea1.html). It was a very tactical match as Chelsea sat back for the most part and Barca just couldn't find a way through the defence. The [United and Arsenal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0429/manchesterutd_arsenal.html) was a different affair though. United had the majority of chances and Almunia kept Arsenal in the tie. It was only after United stepped off the pedal did Arsenal come back in to the match. Still all to play for in both matches.



Thursday at work we got our free DSi and a copy of 'Professor Layton' to play on it. This was because we had the biggest improvement on DSi pre-orders in the weeks running up to the launch. We had originally thought that we would only be getting one DSi for the shop so it was a great surprise when eleven arrived! Paula came over to the flat after work and football and we had a bit of a go at solving a few puzzles. Today I did a bit of shopping and took a few photos of the shop for Becky. Apparently she's doing an assignment where she has to render an image of a DS and she needed something for the background. Paula also came over after work and we solved a few more puzzles. Man that game is addictive!

I've also finished reading 'Death Star' and will soon be starting on the 'Legacy of the Force' series which I have been looking forward to for a long time.

Paddy.
