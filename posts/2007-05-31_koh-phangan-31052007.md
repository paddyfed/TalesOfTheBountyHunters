So still on Koh Phangan but we're getting used to the climate a bit. We're not always wilting in the heat, at least I'm not. We are quite a bit away from the full moon party but it's just a long taxi ride away. The place that we're staying is quiet so at least we'll get a bit of sleep in the early morning.

> It really was quiet where we were staying. I only remember seeing one other guest in the whole complex. We were very close to the beach here too and there was a great bar that we went to a few times. It was so relaxing. I think it was around this time that we managed to lock ourselves out of the room. We had to get the owners up in the middle of the night to try and open the door. There wasn't even a spare key apparently! So in the end they broke into the room credit card style. Shows you just how easy it is to break into a room.

We're going scuba diving on Sunday which will be interesting for me to say the least! Just hope I don't sink as usual! Tomorrow will be a day for relaxing before heading out for the party. Hopefully I'll have a bit of a liver left to continue the adventure!

Cya later,
Paddy.
