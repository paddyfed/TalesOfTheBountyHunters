What a class weekend! On Saturday afternoon Landers picked me up and we drove down to Carrick where Sweets was taking us the rest of the way. We stopped in Drogheda to pick up Elaine and then we were on our way. We got word that Kat had been in Dublin all on her own since about eleven in the morning! She had to get an early train because all the other trains were booked up because of the rugby.

We finally got to our hostel and met up with Kat and basically got ready to go out. We tried to get to a pub on Grafton Street but it was packed so we ended up in Cafe En Seine where we had something to eat and watched the [Ireland vs England](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2009/0228/irelandvengland.html) match. It wasn't a totally convincing display from Ireland but a good defensive display and we came away with the right result. O'Gara had a bit of a shocker though!

After the match, and we also met up with Yvonne and Maria, we went to Fitzsimons for a drink but it was fairly quiet so we didn't stay too long. We were going to go to Bondi Beach too but luckily Landers called just before we went in. They were in the VAT house so we joined them there. Maria went home and Elaine went back to the hostel but the rest of us went to Club-M to finish off the night. Kerr also joined us for a while. We eventually got back to the hostel at about four in the morning!

Next day we got up and the guys went for a bit of breakfast. I wasn't feeling up to it though. They then got a taxi to go and pick up Sweets' car. I went to the flat, however as I was heading to my Aunts house to help her with her computer. I also got to watch the [Carling Cup final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0301/manutd_spurs.html) between United and Spurs which was a really boring match. That evening I got the bus down to Athlone and I stayed in Eithne's house.

On Monday I helped Eithne with a few things on her computer but I couldn't stay too long as I had to get the bus back to Monaghan. I didn't take the direct route either as I headed back to Dublin and then got a bus from Dublin to Monaghan. It was a long journey, thankfully my mp3 player lasted the whole time. I think I got back to the flat at about eleven that night. It was a long weekend!

Paddy.
