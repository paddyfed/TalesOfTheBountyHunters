Back in Sydney for one day, stayed in Ali's house last night as he was kind enough to put us up. So went out to the Irish club to watch the Munster match and what a great match and result. As you can imagine the majority of the crowd were supporting Munster so there was a great atmosphere. The bar did close very early though and we were kicked out as soon as the match was over. We just headed home after that and had a few more beers in the house. Didn't do much on Sunday. Went around town again and went to see Indiana Jones in the cinema. Not a bad movie but not the best in the series. After that we went back home and played Pictionary which I'd never played before but which is a really good game. Anyway on to Monday when we had to head on back to Sydney for the one night. The flight was a bit bumpy at the start but it was fine. Met a sound fella on the plane too. Elaine decided to talk to him for the duration of the flight but I think his sense of hearing has recovered :D . So as I said we stayed in Ali's last night and today we're headed off to New Zealand. Staying in Christchurch for a couple of days before we decide where to go. Oh and this day last year we left Ireland and headed to Bangkok for the start of our journey.

16 days left and how time flies,
Paddy.
