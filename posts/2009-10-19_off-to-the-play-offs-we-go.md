Friday was quiet enough, Paula was working in the evening so I went down to see her for a while. We headed out to her house and watched a bit of TV and she left me back in on Saturday morning when she was heading to work. Later that evening it was the [Ireland vs Italy](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1010/ireland_italy.html) match in the world cup qualifiers. They played really well but it was really sickening to let in that late goal. It was also Kevin Quinn's 18th Birthday so we left the West, where we were watching the match, and headed down to the Shamrock. As you can imagine it was all very exciting although Kevin's friend 'Panda' finishing off a full pint of Guinness in about seven seconds was impressive. We headed to McKennas for one after that and then headed back to the flat.

Paula was back at work on Sunday and I headed out home for dinner. The girls were out home too so it was a nice surprise. Monday was back to work and football as usual although I was feeling really annoyed about work and really didn't want to be there. Paula came over to the flat for a while though and that cheered me up when she went home though she didn't feel that well, bit of a flu coming on she thought.

She didn't go to college on Tuesday and it looks like she'll miss the whole week due to her hospital appointment on Thursday. She felt really sick on Wednesday too but there was nothing I could do. Thankfully her appointment went well. There was the final qualifying match on Wednesday too as [Ireland played Montenegro](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1014/ireland_montengro.html) in a really disappointing match. Adam and Neil did go to it though!

On Thursday I didn't feel well at work so I had to go home. I still didn't feel too well in the evening so I had to give football a miss. As I said Paula's appointment went well and she came over to the flat for a while as we watched 'Black Books' although I think she was still a bit groggy from the anaesthetic. I was fine again by Friday so I went into work again. That evening I headed out to Paula's house and we had a Chinese for dinner and we watched some more 'Black Books'.

Paula was working on Saturday but we got up early and headed out to pick Emma up for work too. Mum and Dad were away in Donegal with Eamonn and Patricia. I headed into the flat and went back to bed for a while. I eventually got up and did a bit of shopping for myself and then headed down to the bookies. We dropped Emma back home and then headed out to Paulas house where we had a chicken pasta meal maker for dinner and watched the X-Factor. I died a little inside! This was also the day that [Mr Balloon made his d√©but for Sunderland](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1017/sunderland_liverpool.html).



Sunday we picked Emma up again and I headed back to the flat. Jade wanted help with a film that she is trying to make so we went out home to try to use the firewire port on the computer. Unfortunately she didn't have the right cable so we couldn't do what we wanted. I did show her how to use the USB on the camera though. When I got back to the flat I watched the [Brazilian Grand Prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/1018/buttonj.html) and Button finally wrapped up the championship after a disappointing drive from Barrichello. After that we left Emma back home and headed out to Paula's house. The Quinns were over and we sat and watched Match of the Day. A few of Paulas relations came over for a while too and I got a lift back to the flat with Martin and Dympna.

So its round to Monday again and I was working in the morning. I also was talking to Dad in the shopping centre and they had a nice time in Donegal. There's football this evening and the draw for the play-offs was made and of course Ireland got France. So that'll be two matches to look forward to.

Paddy.
