I started another new Next.js project over the last few weeks. It has been something that I have been looking to do for a long time. It is a site that shows my collection of Star Wars books in the form of a bookcase.

[Star Wars Bookcase](https://star-wars-bookcase.vercel.app/)  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/paddyfed/star-wars-bookcase/)

It's basic at the minute but I hope to someday take a scan of the book spines so that I can use these images instead of the outlines that it shows at the minute. I can sort the books by the release date and by the timeline in the Star Wars universe. I also have separate pages for Legends and Canon books (although the deployment doesn't want to work at the minute so it is only showing Legends).

Some of the Canon books I haven't bought yet so I would like to indicate that in some way and I want to include the Star Wars TV shows in the list.

**Update**

The deployment has worked now. The issue was the error logs weren't being shown so I couldn't see what the issue was. When the logs were finally fixed I could see that it was a data fetch issue with the API. So I had to return to using the old API URL, deploy the project and then update to the newly built API routes and deploy a second time.

Paddy.
