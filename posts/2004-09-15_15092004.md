Wouldn't you know it! As soon as I get the site up and running the host AnyXHost does a runner! Typical! Now I'll have to move back to ProHosting even though I hate the banners and pop-ups that they have. Unless I can find some other free site I think I'll soon have to think about actually paying for web space. I guess it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world; at least I could get some reliability and accountability if things go wrong.

I just came back from Donegal again on Monday. I was up at Bird's 21st birthday bash which was pretty cool. I was as sick as a dog on Thursday though, I didn't move from the bed until late in the afternoon and that was after everyone else who I came up with went home. We went out again on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for pints. Bird's family are really groovy people and I think I got on well with them.

So I guess I'll be looking for a job now. The thing is I'm not really sure what I'd like to do. I'd love to do web design but I don't know if there's much call for it nowadays, plus most people would be expected to know things like flash or JAVA which I either don't know or don't like doing. Oh well on to recruitireland.com and irishjobs.ie for me...
