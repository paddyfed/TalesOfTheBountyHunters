We're still in Cairns but we have moved into our new house in White Rock. It's about 15 mins from the city but there's loads of buses going from outside our house. The house is great. It's big with a jacuzzi outside and round the corner there's a pool and tennis court. There's also a supermarket, video shop and a McDonalds nearby. The local pub is a bit far but there's a golf course which has a 19th hole right beside us so we'll probably use that.

> We did try to go to the golf course once. It was late at night and we decided to go just for a few quiet drinks. Of course the club was closed for some reason and we only found out after walking all the way through the course itself. So we then decided to take a taxi into town and just went on the rip.

There is a bottle shop beside McDonalds so if we're desperate we can go there. There's also a cinema and a bigger shopping centre about 5 minutes away on the bus so we're sorted. Not much else to tell. Just gonna start the job search soon. Apparently there's loads of jobs going we just need to find one that pays well.

> Don't know where I got the idea that there were loads of jobs. I guess there were in the pubs but nowhere else was hiring. And I completely forgot about a night out that we had. It was the Frog and Toad pub crawl. I think we went to it on Friday and it was a crawl around a few of the night spots in Cairns. They took us to Tropos where we had the toad competition thing. We were also in PJ's and Rhinobar, I think. I don't remember if we went to the Woolshed. It was a good night but I don't think it was much of a bargain. It was a good way of seeing a few places around the town though.
