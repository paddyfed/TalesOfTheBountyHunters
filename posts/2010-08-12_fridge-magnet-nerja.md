Here's the first in a new section here on TotBH...Fridge Magnets.

Neil started off the fridge magnet craze a few years ago. Every time someone went away on holidays they had to bring back a fridge magnet for everyone and so the collection started. I've now decided to document each magnet that I get starting with this one.


This was given to me by Adam and Michelle who were on holidays to Nerja in Spain from the 1st to the 6th of August 2010. They were there with Pamela and they stayed in Owens flat. They had a good time, apparently the temperature was around 36 degrees every day!

There are other magnets on the fridge in the flat, some are mine, most are Adams so I've decided to let him have all of those and I'll start my own personal collection. If you want to send me a fridge magnet from your own travels then just comment and I'll get in touch.

Also I haven't forgotten about the other [fridge related section](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/Fridge) on the site either.

Paddy.
