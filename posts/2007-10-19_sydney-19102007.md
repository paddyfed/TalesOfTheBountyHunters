So been in Sydney for a few days. Still no job but there seems to be a lot more options around here than in Cairns so that's good. Just been walking round the city seeing the sights like the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. I'm staying in a hostel in the middle of the city so it's really easy to get around.
> Sydney is a great town. I really enjoyed myself when I moved down here. It was also the first time that I had ever travelled anywhere on my own. The first time you see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge it really takes your breath away. I stayed in Wake Up! hostel again cause I knew where it was and, as I said, it was quite central to everything.

Staying with a German guy, a French guy, a Danish girl, an English guy and his Canadian girlfriend. They're all fine to get along with but some are leaving today so some new blood will be arriving soon we think. Spent the day walking around with Tanya, the Danish girl, and Pierre, the French guy, looking for work. I'll have to print out a few more CV's though and hand them in to places. That's the plan anyway.
> We walked all around town. From the hostel to the Opera House. Around the Botanic Gardens and Mrs Maquarie's Chair. All the way into Kings Cross and back to the hostel. I'd already left my CV in to GAME in Bondi Junction to see if they had any openings and I got the line that I'd used a thousand times. "Not sure if we're looking for anyone at the minute but hand in your CV and I'll make sure the manager sees it. We will be looking for Christmas temps though so you never know." The guys working there did seem to be sound anyway so it wouldn't have been the worst place to work. I also put my CV into EB Games. They both got back to me but only after I'd already started work with Peoplebank.

Otherwise things are going fine. It's a bit difficult to find a bit of space on your own in a hostel but at least it's not boring. Well I'm off to bed to read and then sleep as is my custom.

Smell ya later,
Paddy.
