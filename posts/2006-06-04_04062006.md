Yesterday we went to Ballymena to my cousin's 21st/22nd Birthday party. What a great day it was too, there was a bouncy castle, loads of beer, great chat amongst the cousins and talk about fantastic weather. I did bring my camera but I'd forgotten about it during the day and so I've only a few photos none of which are worth putting up.

Got Half-Life 2: Episode One the other day, I don't think that its gonna be as good as Half-Life 2, it seems very slow to get going. Downloading a lot more stuff from the net these days too, loads of music and a few old cartoons and stuff. We only managed to get about 7GB worth of stuff downloaded in our first month.
