I was working on Wednesday but headed out to Paulas house for a curry dinner afterwards and we sat and played the Sims 2 all evening. I had a chiropractor appointment on Thursday morning so Paula left me back into town. I went to work after that and then football and I got a Montie for dinner. I then got the bus up to Letterkenny and Brian picked me up from the bus depot.

I was up around eleven on Friday and we headed to Derry. Paula had another exam today and everything went well, though it wasn't the exam that they expected. The rest of the guys then joined us at the airport and we flew over to Liverpool. We waited in the Airport for a while as Niall was flying in from Cork. We then headed to the hotel to get booked in and headed straight to the pub. We had quite a bit to drink that night!

We got up the next day and headed to watch the [FA Cup Final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0515/chelsea_portsmouth.html). I did have a bit of a hangover so I sat and nursed the one drink for a long time. After the match we headed back to concert square and went in and out of bars there all night. I sat chatting to this South African cop and her friend all night before eventually going home after I could drink no more.

So we were up on Sunday and thankfully [no hangover this time](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/09/stags-good-sick-bad.html). We went to the airport but the flight was cancelled about two minutes before it was due to leave, all due to [the ash cloud](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0516/travel.html). So we went back to the hotel and hired a bus to take us to Stranrar where we could catch a boat to Belfast. The driver seemed just as hungover as we were, he nearly burned the van down because of his cigarette, there was strange smoke coming from the gear stick and to top it all off we nearly ran out of diesel! Eventually we got home and Dad and Emma came to Belfast to pick me up. That was one long day!

I stayed in bed for most of the day on Monday recovering. Paula had another exam and again it all went well. She came over to the house for a while to say hello. I headed to football that evening and played Splinter Cell co-op with Adam. Today I was out at Paulas for dinner. We watched a bit of TV and Becky called to see if Ciara and Niamh could help her with her project.

Paddy.
