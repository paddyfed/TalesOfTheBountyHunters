The job hunt has started in earnest now. I've applied for about 12 roles over the last while. Most I haven't heard back from and a few have replied to say no luck. I'm not sure what to do in the meantime, whether I should try to create sites or projects on my own to show my skills or whether I need to go back to education. I've been accepted for the FIT apprenticeship but it still requires a company to take me on.

I could try to update the project that I recently submitted to the Front End Web Development course. It's currently hosted on GitHub Pages but because they don't allow SSR I had to do all the API calls from the client. So I might re-do the project as a proper site and host on vercel where SSR is allowed. There are also a number of other suggested projects that I could start on like a task manager or weather app.
