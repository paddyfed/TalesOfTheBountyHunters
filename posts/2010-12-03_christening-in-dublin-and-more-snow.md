Saturday: We got up and it had been snowing again. We weren't going to go to the christening but we decided to get in the car and see how bad it was. The roads weren’t too bad when we got going and we stopped for hot chocolate on the way. The christening was in Blanchardstown and the priest was a bit unusual. We went to a leisure centre for the food afterwards and we watched the [United vs Blackburn match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/1127/manunited_blackburn.html). We came back down the road and stopped in Ardee to get some food and to mess around with a little trolley. We eventually got home after a very slow drive from Blayney onwards. We were meant to meet up with Mark and Sarah but it was too cold and horrible so we watched Toy Story instead. James was over on a sleepover too.

Sunday: We got up and entertained James for a while before Caroline, Kevin and the girls came over. We had dinner and watched the [Ireland v Argentina match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2010/1128/ireland_argentina_report.html). We also watched Toy Story 2 and went to bed soon after. We were chatting about work again and Margaret came into the room and didn’t look too impressed.

Monday: Sean left me to work in the morning, it took Paula 55 minutes to get to her work! I was working until 2 and I got a taxi home. We did a bit of tidying and moved boxes up to the roof space and took a few old computers down. We tidied a bit of the good room too and there was a huge spider in the dining room.

Tuesday: I was in work until 2 again, there was no more snow but the roads were still pretty bad. Emma was in town too so I walked around with her for a while and then got a taxi home. Becky and Emma washed the plates in the kitchen and I was chatting to Paula on the phone. She is going to stay in our house tomorrow night. I also finished watching all of Red vs Blue and we found out that Mum is going to be in hospital for at least another two weeks.

Wednesday: I was working at 1 so I got a taxi in again. The day was going very slow though Paula was finished up early. She collected me from work and we headed home and Emma had dinner ready. We watched 'Nativity' on DVD which was quite funny and we headed to bed soon after it. Paula said that she was weighing up her options, A) find another job, B) back to college to maybe do teaching or C) head off somewhere for a while, maybe America.

Thursday: Paula left for work in the morning but got there much earlier than usual. I ordered a taxi for 12 but Gwen forgot about me so I was a bit late for work. Brian and Marie text to say that they wouldn't be down due to the weather so we might not see them until after Christmas. There wasn't any football this evening either.

Friday: Elaine had to cancel her party today because of the weather. I headed out to the house after Paula finished work, I had walked around town for a while but there wasn't anything to buy, we sat and watched TV for the evening.

Paddy.
