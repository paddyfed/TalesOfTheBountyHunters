I think I've watched most of the extras on the Star Wars DVD's by this stage. There's still a few documentaries that I have to look at so whenever I get a bit of spare time. South Park is about to start again so new downloads should be forthcoming. I think I'll download them in this place in town that has broadband access and allows you to burn CD's. I should be able to do that during my lunch break at work. That's going well too, I'm actually getting to know the stock and don't need the manager to do everything for me. There's still a lot to learn though. GTA: San Andreas is released on Friday and I'm seriously thinking of getting a PS2 so that I can play it! I'll need to think about it a bit more though, they're a bit expensive like.
