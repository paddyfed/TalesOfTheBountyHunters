I didn't really sleep that well on Sunday night so I was really tired going to work on Monday morning. I was in all day to but thankfully I wasn't in too bad a mood. In fact I was quite hyper for the most part. I didn't play that well at football in the evening too however I will claim two goals. The first was a long ball from the goal that hit off Pauric and went in and the second was an interception on half way with a lovely shot to the far post pass Johnny in goal. So I guess it wasn't a bad day.

I was working in the morning on Tuesday and I was even more tired today! Thankfully Paula was coming over to the flat for dinner so that cheered me up. I went and got a refill pad for her and got the food and when she came over we made dinner together. We watched a bit of 'Black Books' and we only have two episodes left! After that we chatted for the rest of the night about Christmas and what we were going to do and what presents to buy. Oh and [Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1124/liverpool_debrecen.html) so that was good, though they'll probably win the Europa League now!

Again I didn't sleep well and I couldn't get up today even though I planned to do a bit of tidying. I got Paula to call me in the morning to try to wake me but it didn't work. I was just too exhausted. I eventually got up at two and went to collect Paula's present and wrap it. She came over and we had a Chinese for dinner while we watched the [United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1125/manunited_besiktas.html) even if it was really boring and a crap loss. Paula was really tired too though so she went home early, she did buy me '[Star Wars: Clone Wars Season One](http://www.starwars.com/theclonewars/news20090715.html)' on DVD though so I'll have to pay her back for that.
