Well what an interesting week. Last weekend we went out for a few pints on Saturday, just for a bit of craic. That was a good night although we didn't go mad in any way. I did go into work on Sunday severely hung over though. We did decide to go out for a few drinks on Sunday. Although we went out with the best intentions, it all went out the window when the Forum was mentioned. So we went out and I had the most drunken night I've had in a long time. The next morning, again at work, you couldn't talk to me for the hangover. It was all a bit of fun anyway. I'll be heading out tonight but at least I'm not working until Tuesday.

Just want to say good luck to a mate of mine Darren who headed off to England on Wednesday to look for work. I hope he has more success over there than he did over here.
