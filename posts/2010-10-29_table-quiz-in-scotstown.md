Saturday: We went to do the messages in Emyvale during the day and even managed to go for a walk too. Paula headed to mass for seven and I got ready as we were heading to Deerys for dinner. We ate far too much and didn’t stay for too long afterwards. It was really nice treating Paula to dinner for her graduation. We then went back to my house and spent the night there.

Sunday: After sleeping in a bit we headed to Paulas house for dinner. Thankfully there wasn’t too much said. We watched a replay of the [Korean GP](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/1024/korea.html) and went for a walk. We watched MOTD and headed to bed quite early. We also were organising Elaines 'party' and I might be doing up some invites.

Monday: Even though it was a Bank Holiday Paula was still working normal hours. So we were up early and I was working at 12. There weren’t too many in the shop either. When I got home I ordered Rock Band drum silencers and the Star Wars bed sheets for Elaine online. I also called Paula for a chat.

Tuesday: I was working in the morning and I bought hooks to hang my diplomas. I headed out to Paulas for dinner and the Girls and James were having a sleepover. I had brought ‘The Hunchback of Notre Dame’ to watch but the Girls went to Granny’s house instead so we entertained James for the evening and went to bed.

Wednesday: I was up early and back home for eight. I went back to bed for a while and was in work for one. Paula picked me up after work and we made turkey curry at her house although we used natural yoghurt instead of double cream. We then went to Granny’s to visit Ted and Eileen. Elanor, Eibhlin and Siobhan were there too and Adam and Stephanie came over for a while as well.

Thursday: I was up around half ten and got a lift home. I brought my football gear to work and got a lift from Friary to Ballinode. We eventually lost and I headed home. Roboto had arrived though and we watched Celebrity Juice and Million Pound Drop on TV.

Friday: I was working all day but I did meet up with Elaine and Paula for lunch. I bought Rock Band 3 and the new keyboard but left it at work as it was quite bulky. Paula picked me up and we went to her house and we headed to a table quiz in McCagues in Scotstown. We finished joint first and only missed out when we didn’t know Gay Byrnes wife’s full name. Paula won a tin of biscuits, Ultan won two bottles of wine and Elaine won €100 in the envelope draw. Mine cost €12 while Paulas cost €14.97! We got home and I slept on the couch.

Paddy.
