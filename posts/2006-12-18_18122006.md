Had our staff party last weekend for GAME and what a class night. We started off with a few drinks in the Pig and moved onto Jurells for our food. It was good food but the craic was better. We then went to the Tavern in the West and stayed there for most of the night. We all had a great laugh especially at Paul and Neil's attempts at dancing. There are some class photos of that night too. ![In the Forum](/images/20061217_020545_game_christmas_2006_41.JPG "In the Forum")

We then went to the Forum and although the nightclub was shite we all had a great time by staying together on the second floor just beside the bar. After the night was over we all made our way home but Neil, Adam and I stayed up for another few hours playing drunken Guitar Hero.
