Since the last proper update a good few things have happened. I finished up in Monaghan Institute and will be graduating from the level 5 course in November. I passedthe Adobe exams for Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Photoshop. I went back on the welfare for a few weeks and had planned to start up a new business or maybe go back to Monaghan Institute to do the level 6. I then got a few weeks work in CMETB, in their Cavan office, as an Instructional Designer. It was to help create an online module to teach students the benefits of academic integrity.

I am nearly finished up that job, there's probably only about a week to go, so after that I imagine I will be back on the welfare for a week or two before I might find out if I am eligible to get a grant for completing the level 6 course. If that doesn't happen then I will likely just start up the business, hopefully with welfare support. If I can go to Monaghan Institute then I might still need to start the business to help support myself through the year.

My car had it's first NCT and passed. I had to update this website as node.js 18 was not going to be supported from 1st September onwards. I have another few projects to update too with the same issue.

We have renovated our spare bedroom. It had been a dumping ground ever since we moved in and we really wanted to be able to house visitors if the need ever came up. Well the need did come up as Becky's children are coming on a sleepover so we really needed the extra bed. We haven't done much about the en-suite for now. We have the old built-in wardrobe removed, the walls painted, new floors and skirting board, new bedroom furniture (along with a new mattress for us), and a new wardrobe (which was a bit of a pain to build). So far, we are very happy with the result. We moved the double bed that was in that room to Patrick's room and got rid of the two single beds. It seems as though there is a lot more room now. I will likely need to put the insulation down over that room now and I would love to get a few more loft boards down too.

I've been looking over my very old site and wondering how could I incorporate some of these in to this site. But that might be a project for another day/month/year.
