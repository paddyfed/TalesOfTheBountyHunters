![Hello, is it me you're looking for?](/images/P8120080.JPG "Hello, is it me you're looking for?")

So nearly the end of August and we're about halfway through our stay in Cairns. After that there's a bit of discussion as to what we'll do but Frasier Island and the Gold Coast have been mentioned so have Perth, New Zealand and a host of other things. But we'll see. In other news we have a few other things that we've organised for up here. On Wednesday we're seeing Chopper and in about two weeks it's Arj Barker. Hopefully they'll be good/funny and not too disturbing.
> The Chopper experience was a strange one. I guess I was expecting something funny, even though the comedian on before him did have a few good jokes to tell. Instead he was just strange and he told stories from his time as a criminal and they were a bit disturbing, to say the least. Also it was really strange to see the crowds reactions to him and his stories. They seemed to cheer every time someone was shot or killed. So that was a bit off putting. At least we can say that we went.

Apart from that it's the usual drink, work (or not in my case), sleep, repeat routine that we have and we're getting pretty good at it.

We're laughing,
Paddy.
