So this is my last day at Peoplebank. All in all I guess it hasn't been too bad. The work was boring but the people that I worked with have been great. Heading out for a few drinks with them tonight so will probably be extremely hung over tomorrow. It's also Paula's last night in Sydney and they're heading out somewhere in the city so will probably meet up with them at some stage. Oh yea and Iron Man was fantastic. Highly recommended!

34 days left and no more work,
Paddy
