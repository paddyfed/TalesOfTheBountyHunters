I was working on Monday and went to football in the evening. Gerard wasn't playing either, just in case he picked up an injury, so I had to get a lift in with Johnny. Was too tired to make any food when I got back so I had a Montie instead. On Tuesday I wasn't working so I went to look for a Monaghan jersey for Paula but didn't have any luck. Adam made stir-fry for dinner and Paula did come into town for a walk in the evening. On Wednesday it was Johnny's Birthday so we went to the Pig for a few drinks and to watch the [Bayern and Lyon match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0421/bayern.html).

I had to be up early for work on Thursday and I wasn't in great form because I didn't sleep too well. Paula was in the shop to say hello though and she did say that I looked tired. I did got to football anyway and I got a lift to Glaslough with Ashley. Paula made turkey curry for dinner and we watched [Liverpool get beaten by Atletico Madrid](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0422/liverpool_atletico.html).

Paula came into town after college today and she found out that they are now running the fourth year and she doesn't know what to do now. She doesn't want to go back but unless she gets a job it looks like that's what she will have to do. We grabbed her stuff from the flat and had dinner out in her house. We headed to Gift Grub in Drogheda that evening and we headed straight to Killarney after that. Even though we did get lost on the M50, due to the roadworks, we headed to Noras and eventually got to the hotel in Killarney at four in the morning.

We didn't get up too early on Saturday but we did find a café that had spelt bread so Paula was actually able to eat with us. We went shopping and got glasses for Eilish's wedding and we headed to the conference centre ([but not on horseback this time](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/04/scor-sinsear-2009.html).) Gerard was dancing in the set this year and although they did well there was no success this time. We headed back to the hotel for bar food and then back to the Gleneagle for a few drinks and a replay of the dance from earlier. We eventually got home at around half two in the morning.

We managed to get up for breakfast on Sunday, pancakes just for a change, but headed back to bed for an hour. We then headed home and we were in the car all day. It was grand though except for the traffic in Moneygall. When we got back to Paulas house we all went to bed early!

Was back up early this morning and Paula left me into town. I was working with Paul for the first time in ages too and he got me the Star Wars Trivial Pursuit board game. I don't know who will play it with me though!

Paddy.
