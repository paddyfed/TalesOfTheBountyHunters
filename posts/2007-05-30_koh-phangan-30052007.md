Hey what's the craic. Thought this would be the easiest way to let everyone know what the craic is rather than leaving comments everywhere. So we arrived on Monday and time travelled to 3 in the afternoon even though it was 8 in the morning back home. Wrecked tired but still went out for a few Jagers. It's so hot and humid you have to have a shower every two minutes. Thankfully no lady-boys yet but we're keeping an eye out. Stayed in Bangkok for two days, not a very nice city but the drink is cheap.

> Looking back on it Bangkok wasn't that bad to stay in. Our problem was that we didn't know how to deal with the tuk-tuk drivers and all the people trying to sell you crap on the streets and trying to get you to go to ping-pong shows. When we got back to Bangkok a few days later we were able to handle it better. We stayed in this one pub most of the time where we were always served by the one girl called Bee. She was cool but that might have been cause she kept feeding us Jagers.

Today we got a boat trip to Koh Phangan which is a wee island off the mainland. This is where the famous 'Full Moon' party is. We're gonna stay here for a few days then head to another island Koh Samui for a few more days. Then it's back to Bangkok and on to Sydney. Not much else to report, just havin a great time. Photos will be up when we reach Australia so look forward to that.

> Of course I never did get to put up my photos after all that but ah well.

Love yous all, keep in touch. Love the comments! Keep em coming!

Chat soon,
Paddy.
