Just back yesterday from another successful trip down to Dublin. The purpose of this trip was, of course, The Killers concert in Marlay Park! So I got the bus down on Wednesday after getting my hair chopped for the first time since May. So that means all of my Australian and New Zealand hair is gone. It's a sad day indeed. So anyway the concert was on Thursday night so I had a bit of time to kill. How did I spend my time? in front of the TV of course. I blame the crap weather though.

So on Thursday I got a bus out to the park and it took about an hour and twenty minutes just to get out there. The traffic was terrible. So I missed all of Bloc Party and Louis XIV who I think were in Australia with The Killers too. But anyway, after standing in line to get some beer The Killers started up. I eventually met up with Stan and his girlfriend Eimear beside the screen in the middle of the venue. So I hung around with them for the night, catching up with some of the craic. The concert was very short though. While it was good, they played a few songs from Sawdust and not a lot of people knew the words. Although people were livelier when they played songs from the earlier albums. They didn't play the Murder Trilogy though which I was disappointed at.

After the gig I met up with Kerr who lived nearby and we went to the pub for a few more pints. I eventually got a taxi back into town and made my way back to the flat. I eventually got to sleep at about six in the morning and was quite hungover for the rest of the day. So I stayed in the flat recovering. Again the weather didn't help the situation.

So I came back to Monaghan on Saturday and went out for pints with Paula, Elaine and Pamela in the Pig. It wasn't a mad night but the Pig was jammed and we were badly positioned beside the bar. It was quite funny when the DJ didn't play FAME for the girls even after requesting it about five times. I've been uninvited to Christmas dinner for laughing at it apparently.

Paddy.
