Yes so I've finally moved out of home, for the second time, as Adam and I have moved into our new flat on Glaslough Street. On Monday we paid our first rent and the deposit so that came to â‚¬600 which was a lot of money! We did get it all sorted very quickly though so that was good. Basically Adam had moved in by Tuesday and I started moving some things in on Wednesday. There wasn't even any football on Monday because of the heavy snow that we had!

As I said I moved a few things into the flat on Wednesday and Paula came up to have a look around. Dad came up a while later as I was heading home that evening. The flat is great and it's much nicer than Adam's old flat and is actually in a much better location. Thursday we were back to the football and thankfully my knee was OK after the bad bang it got the week before. Friday night Paula went out to meet her ex-banker friends for a few drinks and I stayed in the flat for the first time.

Saturday Adam was working so I went to the Pig to watch the [Ireland vs France](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2009/0207/ireland_frances.html) match, the first round of this years Six Nations. It was a fantastic match, easily the best display by and Irish team in a long time. Adam managed to get in to watch the second half. After that I basically stayed out all night. Brian and Marie were down for the weekend so I met up with them in McKennas. Adam and Paula were out too and later that night Paul and Sorcha came in. Gavin was apparently in the Poc so we didn't see him. Landers and Sara were supposed to come up too but they decided to stay in Dublin because of the snow. Paula stayed over in the flat that night as she was working the next day.

On Sunday I didn't do a thing! It snowed again and Emma text me to say that she couldn't get a taxi to take her into work but I don't think she was too upset. Next week it's the Ireland and Georgia match in the world cup plus that whole valentines thing. Exciting times ahead.

Paddy.
