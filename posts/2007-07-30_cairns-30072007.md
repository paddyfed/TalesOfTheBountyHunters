And we survived the rafting too. I have to say that it was a brilliant day. We were in a boat with four other Irish guys, from Dublin, and they kept falling in.
> We met up with the lads later that night in PJ's. Sound fellas, don't know what our Kiwi instructor thought when a bunch of Irish lads, who mostly couldn't swim, hopped into his raft.

We did fall in a few times but it was intentional. Still didn't enjoy that bit too much! There was one stage that we nearly all fell in by accident. Luckily the raft didn't topple over and we got the guys that fell out back into the raft quickly. At one stage the boat went over and my leg was caught in the upturned boat but I managed to free it and got out. Scared shitless though.
> That really was a hairy moment. Well for all of about 30 seconds anyway. Once I realised that I wasn't actually drowning in the upturned raft I settled down and managed to free myself. Then I was able to get out from under the raft again.

At that stage Sweets floated down the river and was picked up by another boat.
> Funniest thing ever. 'Hey where's Sweets? Oh there he is, about a hundred yards from the raft, floating down river.'

That night we decided to try out a different venue. It was a night club underneath the casino called Velvet Underground. It reminded me of the Hillgrove but with dance music and not the usual crap they play in the clubs here. It's all good and we'll probably find ourselves there again fairly soon.
> The reason I remember it being like the Hillgrove is that the carpet was sticky from all the drink spilled on it, it was quite small and it had an upstairs balcony that you could look over the dance floor much like in the Hillgrove. We never did go back to it though. I guess the Woolshed was just too good.

There's nothing major coming up on the horizon so I guess it's time to find a job.

Chat soon,
Paddy.
