We recently got Solar Panels installed on the house and I've started to keep track of what we are generating and consuming. The panels were installed on the 24th August 2023 by [NRG](https://nrgpanel.ie/) without any fuss. They arrived around 1PM and were finished by 6PM and we were generating electricity from the panels by then.

I am also trying to calculate at what point I will have broken even from the investment. I'm trying to do this by calculating how much eack kWh produced has cost so far. For this first short month we have generated 127.938 kWh consumed or exported. As the total cost of the system was €11,315.42, this means each kWh has cost us €88.44. So this is a bit more than each imported kWh costing us about 0.39c. I think once the cost per kWh is on par with the import cost, we will have pretty much broken even.

| Broken Even        |         |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| kWh Consumed       | 118.271 |
| kWh Exported       | 9.667   |
| Total kWh Produced | 127.938 |
| Price per kWh      | €88.44  |
