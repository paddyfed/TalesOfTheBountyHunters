Look what flashed up when I was looking at [RoosterTeeth comics](http://www.roosterteeth.com) today.

In other news the new MOTUC Club Eternia has been announced and it's 12 main figures, 4 'variant' figures (which I'm not really that interested in) and 4 'beast' or 'multi figure' packs. It will cost &#36;470 plus shipping over the whole year so that's looking to be around &#36;650 (&euro;505) for the year. Guess I can't give up the job just yet. Though thankfully I won't have to worry about getting any of the new 'beast' figures. It goes on sale next week and there will be more information next Friday after SDCC.

We were out at Sherrys last night giving over the present and having a few laughs. Nicola told us about her acupuncture that really helped her with her stomach problems so it might do the same for Paula. And I might go and get my hair cut today. Paula is coming over after work for dinner so I'll have to get a move on.
