What a brilliant match. [Ireland trounced England by 43 points to 13](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2007/0224/ireland1.html). As I said before I was out in Adam's house and we had a great day. We bought a few cans of Guinness to take out to the house with us and I don't think there were many left by the end. Without doubt that was the best performance I've seen by Ireland. They dominated in nearly all areas and this is against the 'mighty' England. Now on to Scotland for a Triple Crown?
