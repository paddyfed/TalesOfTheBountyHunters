So we've arrived back in Bangkok for a few days. We might even get to see some of the sights now that everyone seems to be sleeping again!

> Yes we had a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night. Partially because of the heat and humidity and partially, I think, cause of all the Jager and Red Bull that was consumed. We never did get to see the sights of Bangkok, well outside of a pub anyway.

Koh Samui was cool. Chaweng beach was very busy and there were loads of guys trying to sell you suits and other crap which got annoying. The beach was class and we spent most of our time in this Irish bar where this Thai band were playing a load of songs that you'd recognise. We'll hopefully get them up on YouTube.

> Again it was Tropical Murphy's and I dunno if I'll ever put the videos up. They are quite embarassing. Oh and this was the night that we met up with our German friends who don't drink water.

We then went to this other beach further down the island called Lamai beach. It wasn't as lively as Chaweng but there was nobody to annoy us. Here we went on the jet-skis again and this time I did take part! Scared the living shit out of me but at least I can say I did it.

> It was on Lamai beach that we were drinking the cocktails that seemed to be the gayest concoctions in the world. They were based on the signs of the zodiac so we each bought our own sign. I can't remember who ended up with the pink one, I think it was Sweets.

Oh yea and my camera broke for some unknown reason! I had it in the water and it just stopped working! Some water must've got inside it somehow. So I'll wait until we're in Sydney to see if I can get it fixed or repaired! So the photos might be a bit longer in coming. I feel naked without my camera!

> I didn't get the camera fixed until we were in Cairns. That was really annoying. Incidentally the camera broke again in May but I am getting a replacement.


Cya later,
Paddy.
