Just a month left until Episode III and we've got our tickets already. We're going to see it at 12 O'Clock (midday) at UGC in Dublin on the 19th and again at 6:15 that evening. Can't wait especially after watching the new clone wars cartoons. They didn't have the same impact as the first ones but I suppose that's to be expected. I hope to bring them down to Dublin with me and watch them before seeing Episode III.

I got a pre-owned copy of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, it was a perfect disk and that's why I got it. You forget just how good a game it is.
