Yep I've taken the plunge and decided to head back to GAME at least for the Christmas period. Basically I'm going mad at home and I need something to do so a few hours in the shop will hopefully give me that. So that's the major news of the weekend. Friday night we went out to the Pig for a few drinks. It was Me, Paula, Pamela, Stephanie and Johnny. It wasn't a mad night out but Pamela and Steph were just ever so slightly drunk by the end of the night! I also got a shock during the day when my uncle Artie decided to drop in on us and I was still in my PJ's and dressing gown. It was grand though.

Saturday I went into the flat to play Gears of War 2 with Adam. We went to watch [Ireland demolish Canada 55 - 0](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2008/1108/ireland_canada.html) in the rugby. It was a good match but again Ireland didn't really impress. We watched it in the Pig with Dad and after that we got a carry out and started our marathon gaming session. We managed to get up to act 4 I think, before we finally went to bed at about four in the morning. Sunday, after getting home and having a shower, I was heading over to Stephanie's house for Sunday dinner. A few of Pamela's family were there including wee Ciara and Niamh who took a bit of a shine to me. We also played a bit of pool and Buzz on the PS3. I did beat Sean at the pool which, I later found out, wasn't the best idea I ever had. After that we went back to Paula's house to watch Juno on DVD. We're running out of movies to watch though!!

Monday I was down in Dublin for more Physio. I thought this would be my last trip down but I have to go back in a month. I've given up guessing that it'll be the last time because inevitably it wont. It went well though and I was back in Monaghan today. I just have to concentrate more on my scar massage. Tuesday Adam and I finished Gears of War 2 on hardcore mode. It's a good game but very similar to the first, which I suppose isn't a bad thing. The collision detection is a bit off in some of the levels though, like the big fish thing level. I think we're going to start it on insane mode next.

Love this comic by the way...
