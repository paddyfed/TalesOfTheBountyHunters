So August has come and I've still no job. What's stopping me getting a job in a bar is this RSA cert that you need and it's not that easy to find information on doing the course.
> RSA stands for Responsible Service of Alcohol, by the way, and you need to do this course to get one. Bit like those health and safety things you have to do, y'know the crap ones. The course cost $80 and even after that you weren't guaranteed a job.

But hopefully I'll find something soon. The jacuzzi has been keeping me company though so it's not all bad. Oh yea and on Saturday we had our first proper barbecue. We went looking for a cheap barbecue on Saturday but we could only find gas ones.
> Australian's don't do real barbecues it seems. Just gas ones.

So we bought some of those disposable charcoal ones and it went all right. We just had the usual barbecue fare like sausages and burgers but we also had these lamb butterflies which is just a big piece of lamb on two skewers but no fat! Lovely! Nobody died anyway so that's a plus. It could turn out to be a regular event.

Old Skool,
