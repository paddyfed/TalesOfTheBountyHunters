![Sunny Farm](/images/farm_1.jpg "Sunny Farm, finally completed.")

I'm back in work today but yesterday was a bit of a waste of a day. I sat up until around six in the morning completing the Sunny Farm website in PHP and in JavaScript (which can be found online at my [portfolio site](http://paddyfedoo.web44.net)). Of course this meant that I didn't bother getting up until three in the afternoon. So I did some shopping and made spaghetti sauce for dinner and Paula came over after work and we went for a swim.

We had dinner when we got back and watched Adam play Syphon Filter and Spyro. We also watched a few more episodes of the IT crowd. So now I'm not that tired though I should really go to bed. I've been looking to see if I can get Episode III on VHS tonight too as it's the only one that I need to get to complete the VHS collection. So if anyone is feeling generous...

We're heading to see Ted and Eileen later today too as they're in Monaghan for a few days also can't wait for our Sligo trip this weekend! It's going to be good to get away from everything for a while!

Paddy.
