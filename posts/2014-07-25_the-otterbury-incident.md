This is the first book I can remember reading. I wasn't a big reader when I was young. I'm still not great at reading diverse books. I mainly sick to Star Wars or Tolkien. But when I was younger I was especially bad at reading.

My sister was always the big reader in our house. She always had her head in a book and she's still a big reader today. We used to go to the library in town but I never used to get anything (except maybe Asterix comics) but one day dad must've got fed up with me so he decided to get The Otterbury Incident out for me.

I did read it and from what I remember I did enjoy it. Someday I hope to get a copy to read it again.
