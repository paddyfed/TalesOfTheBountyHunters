Yes the European adventure is all over for another year and it [ended in disappointment for United.](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0527/manunited_barcelona.html) Well beaten by the better side, we only had ten minutes of good solid play and only about two major chances in the match. We watched it in Johnnys house and I was texting Edel before and after the match but even wearing the same shirt as last year couldn't help. 2 - 0 to Barcelona, worthy champions.

Yesterday and today have been quieter affairs. I had met Paula in town on Wednesday evening before she was going to work and we went to Flemings for a non cup of tea. Thursday I did manage to play football and score two of the best goals I'd ever scored. One was a long range shot that flew into the net and the other was a side foot onto the top corner after a long run. I know it's not proper football but when you score so few goals as I tend to you have to celebrate the good ones.

It definitely cheered me up anyway.

Paddy.
