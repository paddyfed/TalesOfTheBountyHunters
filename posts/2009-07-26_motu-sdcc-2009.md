So SDCC is nearly over for another year and I've just been interested in finding out what "Masters of the Universe" characters are coming out. I have to say it's a bit of a mixed bag. Tri-Klops is coming in August as well as He-Ro bonus figure in a weeks time. Also there's Webstor in September, Teela in October, Scareglow in November and King Randor in December. Now apart from the first two I'll definitely be getting the figures, I still have to hope for the best for Tri-Klops and He-Ro.

The only problem I have now is that I'm not that enthused about the bonus figures that are coming out. I went for the subscription so I'll be getting the main figures every month. That includes Adora in January, Trap-Jaw in February and Moss-Man in March. I'll also be getting Wun-Dar as a bonus for the subscription. Now that's a figure that I really have no interest in and will probably attempt to swap him for a Mer-Man or maybe Battle-Cat if I don't manage to get him. The other bonus figures, Zodack in October, Green Goddess in December and Battle Armor He-Man in January I have no interest in and probably won't even attempt to buy. So it's Battle-Cat and the possible re-issues of Faker and Mer-Man that I'll be looking forward to.

Of course there's the possibility that I'll have to pay postage for each figure but there doesn't seem to be any other way around it for now.
