I can't believe its been nearly a month since I've updated here. Madness. Not much has happened though. I am going to work with my Uncle in Belfast next Tuesday. It's not the area of computing that I'm most interested in but at least it's a bit of experience.

The PSP is being released here next Thursday so that's going to be a hectic day at work. There's been loads of pre-orders and I don't know where people are getting the money to buy a console priced at &#8364;255. In other gaming news I've just completed the original 'Half-Life' which really is a good game. It certainly kept me going for a while. Some of the puzzles were difficult but they didn't have you stumped for too long. I'm now in the process of installing 'Half-Life 2'. Hopefully it'll be just as good. I also bought 'Football Manager 2005' but I haven't played it that much. I started with Monaghan United and we won our first match 4 - 1 against Sligo Rovers.
