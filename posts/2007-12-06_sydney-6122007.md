Well another week has gone by and we're still alive. It was a big weekend's drinking too! Friday was the messy drunk night as we met up in PJ's again and got hammered. We ended up in this club called the 'Slip Inn' in Darling Harbour. It seemed like a nice club but it was far too small and it was $20 to get in! Some people didn't even make it to the club (I'm looking at you Becky!). Then we tried to get into Scruffy Murphy's but luckily it was closed! Then it was back to our place for a few Jim Beams and coke. That was the good part of the night. Anyway we all managed to survive the scandals and messiness and moved on with our lives. 
> I guess there wasn't that much of a scandal that night it was just a really messy night. Everybody was really drunk and we all said afterwards that we should've just gone home after we had a great night in PJ's. I don't think it was the last time we said that though. We got back to the flat and just had to sit down for a while and relax.

Saturday was a much better night. We went for a few warm up drinks in the Tea Gardens before meeting up with the gang in the Cargo Bar, again in Darling Harbour. It's a really nice club but so expensive. We just stayed there until Paul got kicked out for putting a plant on his head. 
> Now this was an excellent night, in complete contrast to Friday. We all sat in Cargo Bar (I think this was the first time I'd been in there since before Melbourne) and just had a great time. The plant pot incident was really funny too. Paul kept putting it on his head and the bouncers kept telling him to stop. Eventually they got fed up and kicked him out. We were all well on by this stage so we all just decided to go home. One of the great nights in Sydney.

Sunday we all decided to go for a family dinner at Circular Quay, all 14 of us. Then we went to the Mercantile for a few scoops. Nobody was really in the mood for drinking though. We did go to the 'Cock and Bull' for one to finish the weekend off. Monday was no beer night but we did have the girls staying with us so they cooked dinner for us. They stayed until Wednesday when a few of them went to Perth to shoot some ponies in the face. 
> The shooting ponies thing, I'm not sure of the origin. It was either Mark or Yvonne or Kat who were trying to act all posh and I believe they were trying to say 'ride some ponies', as posh people do. However it came out as 'shoot some ponies' and the 'in the face' bit was added later. Needless to say it was a regular catchphrase and deserved to be on the fridge, if only we had the letters at that stage.

Wednesday night was our contractor Christmas party so we had free drinks at the Cruize Bar. I got hammered and went down to the 'Side Bar' at 'Wake Up!' to meet Jesus. 
> Jesus being Flo, the German guy that shared the dorm in Wake Up before Melbourne, just in case you were wondering.

Didn't manage to get to work until about 11 this morning and it's not been the most exciting day either. Tomorrow is our actual Christmas party so I'll probably have to be a bit quieter.

Only 2 and a bit weeks to Christmas,
Paddy.
