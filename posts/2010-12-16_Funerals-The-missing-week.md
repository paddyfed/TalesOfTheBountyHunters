> I found this post while going through some old files on my computer so I decided to add it into the blog. This was added on 26 August 2025

Saturday: I was in work all day as I was making up for missing out on Monday and Tuesday. Neil was staying in the West so we headed over there to get changed and then headed to the Seasons. Ben and Adam were there already and we had a few drinks while we waited for the others to arrive. We had some finger food and exchanged presents, I got a hat and smelly stuff from Amy. We had a few more drinks and went over to Mexx, with our complimentary passes! I left a bit early as I was very drunk and I even had to get a lift home as there were no taxis!

Sunday: I spent most of the day recovering from the hangover. Mum did get home at three and I played a little bit of Halo 2 in the evening. Paula's uncle Jim died today though, it was really sudden.

Monday: I was working in the morning and went back to Paula's afterwards and we went for a walk around the track. We also went to Pauric and Sinead's to watch the United and Arsenal match but it was as much for a change of scenery than anything else.

Tuesday: We meant to get up early for a walk but I felt very fluey in the morning so I slept on. I felt really crap all day too and only had soup for dinner even though it was really nice. I sat and relaxed on the couch all evening and there werenâ€™t even any visitors.

Wednesday: Gerard left me to work in the morning and Paula picked me back up. We went back to her house and the evening was spent trying to figure out if the funeral would go ahead on Friday. Paula is going to stay in the flat and we went for a walk around the track to clear our heads. Bernadette Kelly was over for a while too and I ordered a Superman figure for Emma.

Thursday: Got up and had breakfast, I had to head home to get a key for Paula and I went to work. Paula was heading to Dublin for the wake and she was staying in the flat. I got home after work and helped a bit with the Christmas tree, the lights were really tangled up! I also ordered a few more Star Wars Omnibus books, the second two x-wing ones, and a C# book.

Paddy.
