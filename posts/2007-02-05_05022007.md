On Friday after work we went out for a few drinks in the POC who were having their birthday party and pints were &euro;2.80 so it was class. After meeting up with Michelle we went over to the Pig and met up with Pamela and Gerard and his sisters. We then went to the Forum and we all got very drunk and made fools of ourselves on the dance floor.
> I do believe that this was the first night that I ever met Paula.

Was out in Adams house all weekend because it was Adams dads birthday. Adam and Michelle had bought him a Guinness fridge so we sat there drinking it all day whilst playing Guitar Hero and darts. On Sunday we watched [Ireland beat Wales in Cardiff](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2007/0204/ireland1.html) by a narrow margin although it was an exciting match. Also watched the [Colts beat the Bears](http://www.rte.ie/sport/2007/0205/superbowl.html) in the Superbowl that night. It wasn't a great match because of all the mistakes but the best team won in the end.

Got our phone in so now its time to look for a broadband package. Were going to get the same deal that we have at home which should cost us &euro;20 a month each which is pretty cool.
