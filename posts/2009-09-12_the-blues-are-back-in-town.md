We went to Deerys for Adam Jebbs 30th and it was a really nice night, the cake was especially funny. We stayed for a few drinks downstairs but most people were working or gettting up early the next day so we didn't stay long. Saturday was the second night of the Blues Festival but it was the [Ireland and Cyprus match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/2009/0905/ireland_cyprus_.html) that took centre stage. We watched it in the Pig and Landers and Carlile were there with Lorraine and Marie. After that we went to McKennas for one but it was too packed. It's the busiest I'd seen it in years! We went down to the Marquee then and we met up with Gavin, Sorcha and Paul. Headed home in the wee hours of the morning.

On Sunday I got up and headed home for my dinner only to find out that all of Dad's ones were coming over. So we had our dinner, watched a bit of [the Hurling final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0906/kilkenny_tipperary_.html?gaa) and then Paula came over for a bit. I introduced her to a few of Dad's ones and then we headed into town. She said that it was very obvious that Eithne sticks up for me anyway. We were meeting Gavin and Sorcha in the Pig and then we headed to the Poc to listen to a few other bands and generally chatting about geeky stuff. We then headed down towards the marquee via Mizzonis but it was closed when we got there and the guy on the door was being a bit of a prick. So that was the end of the night so we headed back to the flat.

Monday morning, with a bit of a hang over, I had to get up early to help Adam move a few boxes in work. Thankfully it only took a few minutes so I was able to go back to bed for another few hours. I eventually got up for work at one and Paula headed home. I was playing football that evening too but I also headed out to McKennas with Gavin and Sorcha to finish off the weekend. I wasn't working on Tuesday so Paula and I went to the cinema to watch Inglorious Basterds. It's by no means Tarantino's best movie but it was entertaining. We were going to go back to the flat but we decided to head out to Paula's house instead.

Wednesday Paula left me in for work and it was the release of The Beatles Rock Band but it wasn't busy. Thursday we couldn't get enough people to play football so Paula came over to the flat and we watched Black Books instead. Friday I was working the late shift and Paula was out with a few of her ex-bank friends. She came back to the flat afterwards and stayed because she was up early for work today.

So I've just basically lazed around the flat all evening. We are going to go out to Glaslough later and go for a walk. The plan is to do nothing this evening as we want to save some money for the wedding. Plus we've been out too many times over the past few weeks that it's good to have a rest.

Paddy.
