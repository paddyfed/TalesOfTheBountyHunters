Thursday evening after football we all went to the Pig for food in honour of Shelly getting a first class honours in her final year at college. It was basically all the McGonnells with Me, Adam and Ustina. It was a really nice meal too even if we didn't get any vegetables. Paula also managed to come in after work so I was happy about that.

Friday evening I met Paula in the bookies and we got a DVD and watched it out at her house. We decided to get 'Milk' with Sean Penn out and it was quite good, if a little uncomfortable watching at times. I stayed in the house that evening and Paula left me in to work the next day. Adam, Johnny Ustina and I watched the [Bulgaria and Ireland match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0606/bulgaria_ireland.html) in Deerys and although the performance still wasn't great we got a good result. We headed back to the flat and I met up with Paula to get a Chinese. We then watched another DVD, 'The Wrestler' in the flat. Again it was good but it's hard to know what the movie was really about or what it was trying to say.

Sunday was our stock take day so it was up early and down to work for ten in the morning. Joy! The day went alright though as we got the shop floor scanned before the shop was opened. It was definitely one of the smoothest stock takes we've had anyway. After that Paula picked me up and we headed out to Caroline's house. Baby James had his Christening today so everyone was still out celebrating. It was a really relaxing evening which I just needed as I was wrecked after work. Plus I haven't been sleeping well lately but that's probably my own fault.

On Monday it was my eighth straight day at work and I dont get a day off until Friday so it'll be eleven days in a row for me. I'm going to be shattered after all that!  I didn't do much after football that evening too although Adam and I did watch 'Zack and Miri' which was a lot funnier than I thought it would be. Today Paulas results were supposed to be released but they've been delayed until tomorrow for some reason. Also she is coming over later and we are going to try to sort out some accommodation for the Isle of Mann which is less than a month away. Also Bill Bailey in two weeks! Can't wait for that!

Paddy.
