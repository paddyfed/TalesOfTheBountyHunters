Monday was a bank holiday so there was no football that evening. I wasn't working either so I managed to order a ['He-Ro'](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.130952400) for me and an ['Egon'](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.127681400) for Adam do it wasn't a wasted day. Paula came over to the flat for a while after work too but she didn't stay long. I was back to work on Tuesday and Paula came into the shop for a chat. Then Sinead came in too and they bought a 360 for Pauric for his Birthday. We were playing football that evening so I left it down to Paula after that. We then got something to eat and relaxed in the flat for a while. Ben and a few of his friends came over that night too for a few drinks.

On Wednesday I was working for a while but managed to get out for a few drinks that evening. Johnny was meeting up with a few work mates and Shelly was on her staff night out too. We went to the West for a few and then Adam, Shelly and I went to McKennas for one. The town was quite quiet though. We went home after that and I talked to Paula on the phone for a while. I was opening the shop on Thursday and Ben was a little hung-over so we didn't do much work that morning. I was also out at football that evening and Paula came over to the flat for some pasta as I had to make my sauce. We were going to head out to her house too but I had to get a memory card ready for Dad who was going to Sligo at the weekend.

On Friday Dad came over to pick up the card and Paula came over to the flat. It was a rare occasion that we were both off and we headed to Middletown to get drink for Paurics party. That night we all went to Deerys for a few drinks and a meal in Paurics honour. Best actress award has to go to Steph for her brilliant performance when she gave Pauric the 'wrong' game. He was really surprised when they gave him his XBOX! Saturday Paula came in to town and we looked for Holsten non-alcoholic bottles that she could take to the party. I then got ready and we headed out to her house and relaxed for the afternoon. We headed out to Paurics for the party at eight and they arrived in at half eight for the big surprise. He had no idea that we were all coming over either! I then played pirates with the girls and we watched Ger dancing in the Scor. I headed back to Paulas house after the party.

So on Sunday we were up for eleven as Paula was working. She left me back to the flat and I sat and watched the [Mayo and Meath match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0809/mayo_meath.html) as well as the [Kilkenny and Waterford hurling match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0809/kilkenny_waterford1.html). Paula will be coming over later for some dinner and to watch Star Wars for the first time. Hopefully she'll enjoy it.

Paddy.
