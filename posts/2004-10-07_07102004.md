Had an interview with GAME today (or is it yesterday now?) and it went well. I guess that was my first proper interview with proper questions like 'think of a time you used your initiative' or 'what motivates you' which you just have to bull on through. So I should be starting there soon (I hope) although I've had no official confirmation. The store itself will be opening on Saturday which is the same day that Ireland are playing France in the World Cup qualifiers! That should be a good match. Also that night we're all going to see Des Bishop at the Garage Theatre here in Monaghan. So I've finally got a night off work.

I've managed to download the newest Making of Episode III Webdoc (10) on the first go! I still haven't managed to download part 9 yet! It's a really good one too! Ah well, here goes attempt number 45.
