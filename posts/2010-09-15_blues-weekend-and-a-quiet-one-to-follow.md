On Friday we had dinner for Dad in the house. It was such a nice day that we actually had a barbecue but unfortunately it was a bit too cold in the evening to eat outside. Ken was over for dinner too. I had a few drinks with dad and stayed the night, I guess I'll have to get used to that. Paula was on her way to Donegal for a wedding.

I headed back to town on Saturday and decided to pack a few things. It was Gavins birthday and we were also having a staff party in Deerys. We all met up there and Emma and Edel were over too. We headed downstairs as soon as we could as it was packed and Gavin, Sorcha and Paul came over too. Eventually everyone got drunk and headed home and I had to babysit Paul and Neil back to the flat.

Sunday I was up around eleven and everyone was a bit hungover. We sat there watching some music videos on the PS3 before Neil and Ben had to go to work. Paula came back down from Donegal and was in the flat for a while and gave me a lift back home for dinner. I headed back into town to meet up with Gavin, Sorcha and Paul in the Poc and McKennas. We eventually ended up back in the marquee to finish off the weekend.

Monday I wasn't too hungover so I headed to work at two to help with the store moves (again). There was football that evening and Paula started going to a palates class. I was in Paulas for dinner on Tuesday and on Wednesday, after work, Adam and Shelly were in the flat and packed a few things up. The flat is starting to look quite bare.

I was at football on Thursday for the first time in a while and it went alright. Paula had a department audit at work and she didn't feel well all day. She headed to the doctor afterwards and found out it was a kidney infection. She was in a lot of pain when she got home but she still managed to give me a call.

I was on the late shift on Friday and I got a lift out to Paulas house with Gerard. I made myself some sweet &amp; sour chicken and it tasted fantastic. Paula still wasn't feeling great so we spent the evening on the couch in front of the TV.

The rest of Paulas ones were away to a wedding on Saturday so we sat in the house all day. We did go to town to get a few things and we were talking to Emma for a while. Paula felt a bit weak though so we soon headed home. We the listened to Martina, Stephanie and Patricia practising for a wedding. We were meant to go to the evening part of the wedding but neither of us felt up for it so we stayed home and watched 'Airplane' on DVD instead.

I got up and watched the [Italian Grand Prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/0912/italy_alonsof.html) on Sunday while everyone else was having dinner. Paula and I went walking in Rossmore park too for a change and she left me out home. We brought a few boxes with us too. I also heard the plans for Donegal and Nannas house though they'll probably never happen. Unless we win the Lotto that is.

I was working on Monday afternoon and it was quiet. I went to football in the evening too and scored a lovely looping goal over the keeper. I totally meant to do that too. We still lost convincingly though. We had a midnight opening for 'Halo: Reach' too so I went down to see what the craic was. There wasn't a massive rush but we did have a few people in. Adam bought his new Halo branded Xbox so I bought his old one off him.

I was in for work at eight on Tuesday although it was quiet until around twelve. I was finished at one so I played 'Halo: Reach' on the TV's at the front of the shop for a while. It actually seems like a great game. We did a bit of a tidy up in the flat when we got home as there was a viewing on Wednesday. We also went to the pub to watch the United and Rangers match although we shouldn't have bothered.

So was up today at eleven and Adam gave me the Xbox and the controllers although I do have to get the 120gb hard drive from Sean yet. I've spent most of the day cleaning for the viewing although Emma did come over for a while. She took another box of clothes home with her. The viewing itself was over and done with in a few minutes and I managed to buy the [Gygor figure](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0914/manchesterunited_rangers1.html). I'm also heading to play football this evening seeing as I'll miss out on Thursday because of work.

Paddy.
