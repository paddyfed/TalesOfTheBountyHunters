On Tuesday we planned to have some food in the flat and to get Fantastic Mr. Fox out on DVD so that's what we did. We got the DVD and made our curry dinner, which was absolutely delicious, and then put the DVD in to watch it while we ate. Unfortunately the DVD they had given us was scratched to bits. So although we couldn't watch it then we did go back and got a different copy of the movie. After all that though it was a very disappointing movie. We also had some ice cream for dessert but that actually made Paula a bit sick. So even though it was still a good night, it was by no means perfect.

Wednesday night did make up for some of it though. It was the second leg of the Champions League last 16 and [United had a fantastic victory over AC Milan](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0310/manunitedacmilan.html) who were actually quite disappointing. It was great pay back after a few seasons ago being knocked out by them twice. The only sad thing is that we wont get to pay [Real Madrid](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0310/RealMadrid_Lyon.html) back this season too.

Today Paula came over to the flat after college to say hello and she also asked me to help her with some photos that she needs to take. I was glad to help in any way I can. I had football in the evening again too and again we won. It's getting to be a bit of a habit!
