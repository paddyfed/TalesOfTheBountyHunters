This is just a quick post to say that I GOT MY BATTLE-CAT!!! I was on from five and it took me about 20 minutes to order but I eventually got through! I also ordered some stands but only really because I was already paying for the shipping. So He-Man's most trusted companion should be arriving in 20 working days. There's been a few new figures announced too like Count Marzo, Tytus (who is another big figure) and She-Ra will be coming as part of the subscription in June. There's now talk of the bonus figures coming as part of next years subscription which I'll be all in favour of if it means I wont miss out on any more. Although some of this years bonus figures haven't been great and I'll still need to order King Greyskull, Faker and Mer-Man when/if they're re-issued.

Edit:&nbsp; Just had to put this in, somebody's description of todays events on [MattyCollector.com](http://www.mattycollector.com/) posted on FaceBook.

> I went to a lemonade stand today and went to buy some but when I got up to the little girl she said "sorry, 1 of the items in your hand is sold out".. so I went back and removed the ice cubes, but that wasn't it, so I removed the lemons, and that wasn't it, so I poured out the water and that worked but then by the time I got back up to her the lemons, ice cubes and glass were all gone. I got a palm full of water, which wasn't really sold out after all. And I couldn't use my coupon since I didn't get lemons. So I punched her in the face.
I'm also now on my way home to eat some pancakes.
