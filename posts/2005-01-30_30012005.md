So there's only 50 days left until Clone Wars season 3 is released, that means I need to get my finger out and see about getting Hyperspace back. I'm going to get my own credit card so that I can get books and things online by myself but I need to get a passport or some method of identification first. So that's my next task but it's gonna cost me at least &#8364;75 to get a passport. It'll be worth it though to get the Clone Wars season 3 and maybe a proper host for this site.

By the way happy [Winter-een-mas](http://www.wintereenmas.com/) to you all. I bought The Sims 2 but I haven't played it that much yet. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas still takes up most of my gaming time.
