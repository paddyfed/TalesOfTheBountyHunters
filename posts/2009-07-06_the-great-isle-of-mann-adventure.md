We were heading over to the Isle of Mann to help celebrate Daniels 18th. Along for the trip were Me, Emma and Paula. Pauric and Sinead left us down to the port on Friday morning, no thanks in great part to the sat nav that nearly got us lost a few times. We got the boat and the crossing over was grand, even if they didn't have enough rice! Andrea picked us up at the other side and left Me and Paula off at the Claremont Hotel. We rested in the hotel for a while and went out for a few drinks in Jacks just up the prom.

On Saturday we were up early and we headed to Laxey. We took the electric tram there and back and got absolutely soaked. We did climb to the top of the wheel though and even went into the mine entrance and we also got the horse tram back to the hotel. We had a bit of a power nap when we got back to the hotel and we watched the brothers play in the doubles final at Wimbledon. Daniel then picked us up and took us to the party. Ryan was already dressed as Captain America and Dan soon got into his Batman costume. Emma was dressed as Supergirl too. It was a really good party although a bit messy at times. Daniel soaked Emma with his bottle of Champagne and Ryan decided to spill his drink all down my t-shirt. We eventually got back to the hotel at about two in the morning after an interesting taxi ride home.

On Sunday we were up early and had a shower and headed out to walk around the prom. It was a really lovely day, too bad we didn't pick today to go to Laxey but no matter. I picked up the Ghostbusters cartoon on DVD too in HMV and the guy serving us recognised the Monaghan shirt I was wearing. We got back to the hotel and had a Chinese for dinner in the room and we watched the [Wimbledon Mens final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/tennis/2009/0705/federerr.html) and it was really unlucky for Roddick. We met up with Andrea and Emma for a few drinks in Jaks that night too and we nearly got soaked on the way home.

On Monday we were up very early to get the boat back. Andrea, Daniel and Ryan all came over to see us off. Thankfully we slept most of the way back as the crossing was a bit rougher. We got back to the flat and watched a bit of the Ghostbusters while having a bit of a nap. We had pizza for dinner and eventually got the bus back to Monaghan. Elaine picked paula up from the flat and I spent the rest of the day recovering. We also found out today that Sean Grahams is closing in the next few weeks which really put a damper on what was a great weekend.

Paddy.
