I've been very busy over the last month or two. Being back in college doing the level 6 Creative Media course while also working in CMETB has left me with very little free time. It has been tough so far. We have a lot of assignments and while some are not due until April or May, they are big projects so they need to be kept going every so often. It's hard to prioritise things sometimes, especially the assignments that are more like reports than practical. I did enjoy the assignment where we created a collage and I think it's something that I want to continue trying out.

In the past few days I have registered for Income Tax and VAT so that I can finally start up my business. I registered for VAT so that I could be seen as a legitimate business and not just some random who will disappear after taking your money. I want to concentrate on the web side of things and promotional photos and videos rather than the constant social media postings. I have created a site for the business at [snapandcode.ie](https://snapandcode.ie) but it's a bit bare at the moment. I will add any projects that I do to that site and hopefully it will build up over time. It could be tough to keep up with everything but I'm going to give it a go anyway.

With the setting up of the new business I have invested in a new computer. The laptop that I have been using for the last few years is starting to struggle a bit when editing photos and editing video. I decided to buy all the parts separately rather than buying a completed system. The theory is I can swap out parts more easily should I need to improve the RAM or graphics card for example. That was one of the things I found frustrating about the current laptop in that it was not customisable at all. I couldn't add more RAM and I'm not even sure if I could change the hard drive. I will be losing a screen though as I won't have the laptop available as a third screen.
