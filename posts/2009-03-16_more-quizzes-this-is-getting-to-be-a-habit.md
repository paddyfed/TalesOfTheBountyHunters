Yes this Wednesday we went to another table quiz in the Shamrock. This time it was Me, Paula, Adam and Shelly on a team. The quiz was a lot harder than the previous week but we didn't come last thankfully. I had been watching the [United vs Inter](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0311/manutd_inter.html) match in the Champions League but once the second goal went in I was happy enough to leave it. Adam also won two of the spot prizes in the quiz so he was happy with that.

On Friday Paula came over to the flat and we had a Chinese, we didn't go out though as I was going out on Saturday. We went over to Adams house to watch the [Scotland and Ireland match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2009/0314/scotland_ireland1.html) and although I had to deal with the disappointment of [United losing to Liverpool](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0314/manchesterunited_liverpool1.html), the rugby result more than made up for it. It's a Grand Slam decider in Cardiff next!

That night we went out to the West to celebrate Nicola's birthday and it was a bit of a drunken night. We sat upstairs in the Tavern for a while, taking silly photos and then went to the Forum. I didn't stay too long though as I was really drunk and was falling all over the place. Thankfully I didn't have too far to walk! Sunday I was supposed to be helping Paula babysit but I was just a bit too hungover for that! I'll make it up to her next time!

Paddy.
