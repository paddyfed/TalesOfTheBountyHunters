So we're sitting here waiting for the match to start and I have to say I'm not very hopeful! I headed out to Paula's house last night to watch 'Black Books' but we just ended up watching TV instead. She asked me if I thought we had a chance tonight and I said not much of one.

We hadn't seen each other since Sunday morning and it wasn't the best weekend ever. Thankfully we got things sorted and things should get better soon. I have a few updates in draft that I have to finish so that should be up soon.

So good luck to the lads but I think we'll be supporting anyone but England [edit: and France!!] next summer!

Paddy.
