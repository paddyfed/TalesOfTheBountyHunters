I went out home on Wednesday evening to try to fix Dads email, for some reason it wont send emails so there's obviously something up with the outgoing server but no matter how many times it's changed between the two that it could be (although I have my doubts about one of them) it stops working after a while. It was working when I left and hopefully it'll stay that way!

I wasn't working on Thursday and Paula came over to the flat after college. We went around ton for a bit and got some lunch. I had a chicken tikka roll which decided to give me indigestion but thankfully it cleared by football time. Sean was over in the flat too that evening as he was helping out at his schools open day/night. Oh and wee James took some of his first steps today, Paula says he'll not be at football till next week though.

I was working on Friday but Paula came over and met me when I finished. She looked really tired when she arrived so we didn't stay about for long. We headed out to her house and made turkey goujons for dinner. Ger had got 'The Hangover' on DVD as he hadn't seen it so we watched that and it's still as funny as the first time.

I was working on Saturday for the first time in a long time and typical it had to be on the same weekend as the [France and Ireland game](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0213/france_ireland.html). Although it wasn't much to miss! Anyway after work Paula came into the flat and we made our curry dinner and sat and watched TV. We just barely got the energy after our dinner to head for a few drinks in the Pig but I'm glad we did. We went back to the flat after that and I downloaded 'The High Kings' new album from the net.

So Valentines day came around and after the exchange of gifts (i.e. the sweets) and the cards we headed out to Next for a bit of a nosey. We also got a few things in Flemings and then got our take away from the Little Neroni and took it back to the flat. It was really nice but unfortunately Paula didn't feel too well after it. So really we should have made our own food but hopefully if we figure out what's causing her to feel sick we can go out for meals again.

So today, under a bit of a cloud, I was back at work. It did upset me that Paula couldn't relax after the take away last night so I was in a foul mood basically all day. And to cap it all off, at football Colin decided to paste me against the fence trying to get the ball. I've a bit of a sore knee, arm and hand but I'm OK.

Paddy.
