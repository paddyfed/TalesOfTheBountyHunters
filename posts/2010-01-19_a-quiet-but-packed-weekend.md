I was on the graveyard shift on Friday, although it's the first time in a long time so I didn't mind, and thankfully it didn't drag on. Paula came into town and picked me up and she had dinner ready for me when I got out to her house. We then just sat up on the couch watching a bit of snooker and Family Guy on TV.

I stayed in the house that night as we were taking Ciara and Niamh to see 'Alvin and the Chipmunks 2' in the cinema. We had a few races on Crash Nitro Kart and then went off. They were great in the cinema too, not a peep out of them, and we headed back home without much incident. We went back to the house and watched some more snooker and Match of the Day on the TV and we even helped Kevin Quinn with his presentation.

Paula was heading to Carolines on Sunday morning to babysit the girls and James so Ger left me into town for work. Again it was the first Sunday I'd been in for a while so it was grand. Paula came in to the flat after work and we watched 'The Phantom Menace'. She stayed the night because of the threat of black ice on the road and we even got to see the [deciding frame in the Masters snooker final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/snooker/2010/0118/snooker.html).

Paula was back to college proper on Monday so she was up early. I on the other hand wasn't working so I just lazed in the flat all day. Today though I was back at work and again it went quick, mainly because the guy was in changing a router for most of the morning. I also bought new running shoes as I hope to get a bit fitter in the coming months, new years resolutions and all that. This evening too I had my dinner in Paulas house and we headed to Ted and Eileens for a while and watched the [Carling Cup Semi-Final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0119/mancity_manutd.html) which wasn't good viewing for me!
