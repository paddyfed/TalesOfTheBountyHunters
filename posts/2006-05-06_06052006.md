Just got broadband today and it's going well. Already I've downloaded a few South Park episodes and a few film trailers. I'll need to be careful and not go over the limit even if it is generous (20GB).

I'm now looking forward to the new Superman movie. That was one of the trailers I downloaded and it looks cool. I'm actually glad that they seem to be carrying on the story from Superman I and Superman II I just hope it's not going to be too silly.
