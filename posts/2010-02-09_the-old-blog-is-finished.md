So I wasn't tired this evening, not surprising as I didn't really do much today, so I decided to finish off a few of the Australia posts and to finish off the [Old Blog](/tags/Old%20Blog) posts finally. I've still loads to do on the [Australia posts](/tags/Australia) but I'm hoping to get a few done bit by bit. The only problem is that it's coming into the really busy times and I don't know if I'll remember it all or even fit it all in.

Oh and I lost in the football this evening despite scoring. The problem we had was that we didn't have any players that could score where as the other team had all of them. That was some good picking!

Paddy.
