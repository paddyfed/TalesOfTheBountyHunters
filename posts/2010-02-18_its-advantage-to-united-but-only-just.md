It's Pancake Tuesday!! As I said before I was heading out home for Pancakes after [securing my Battle-Cat](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2010/02/pancakes-and-battle-cats.html) earlier in the day. The [AC Milan and United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0216/acmilan_manutd.html) was on that evening too so Ken and I watched it for the evening. I was also trying to look for the number of the people we used to rent off in Sydney but I couldn't find my old phone.

I was working all day on Wednesday and Emma was at a funeral so we had no lunch cover. Thankfully it wasn't too busy and Paul eventually came in to let us have our lunch. I had my banana sandwiches in with me at any rate. After work Paula came over and we went for a walk in town. She came up to the flat and we had a really good chat about things, the future and other things. She told me that she once thought that I had a thing for an ex work colleague, that was funny!

I was working again today and Paula came over for a while too. She ordered a dress online and is getting it delivered to Newry so that she can try it on. I had football this evening so we went out to Paulas house and Ger gave me a lift in. Again I managed to be on the winning team but also managed to score, I think it was three in the end so, go me!

Paddy.
