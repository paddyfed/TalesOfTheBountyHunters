What a concert! The Killers played here in the Sydney Entertainment Centre on Sunday night and it was brilliant! Especially when 'Mr Brightside' came on and the very start with 'Sams Town' and 'When You Were Young' just like the start of the album. Other notable songs were 'Bones', 'All These Things That I've Done' and 'Smile Like You Mean It'. Fantastic and much better than the first time I saw them at Oxegen in 2005. 
> It really was a great concert although the crowd were a bit muted it seemed. If we were down on the floor it might've been a different story. It was the first time that I heard songs from their Sawdust album although I didn't know it at the time of course.

Then on Monday it was back to work but not before I got locked out of my room! I went for a shower and when I came back the key card wouldn't work so I had to go down to reception in my boxers to get it fixed. 
> In hindsight I could've just knocked on the door to wake everyone up in the room but seeing as I'm not a complete bastard I decided embarrassing myself was the best option.

Then when I came home and went to make something to eat all my food had been thrown out for some reason. Not a happy camper! 
> It was the day for things to be cleaned out of the kitchen but my stuff was clearly labelled. Some things did turn up a few days later leading me to believe that someone half-inched them and put them back before they left.

Today has been better though as we cooked a dinner for the first time since Cairns.

> Spaghetti Bolognese I do believe.

Ah the good old days! Tomorrow we're supposed to be going out for a few drinks (read piss up) because one of the girls is heading home.

It'll be a quiet Thursday morning for me then,
Paddy.
