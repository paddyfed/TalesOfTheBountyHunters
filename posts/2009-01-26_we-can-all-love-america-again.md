Yes its time for a new President in America and thankfully Barack Obama was the man to clinch the deal back in November. It's not even that I really had any objections to McCain but that Pailin woman would've been a disaster and thankfully it's the end of Bush! I finished work early and I managed to watch the inauguration and it was quite interesting. It'll take a while for the perception of America to change over the world but I think that it will change and for the good.

On Wednesday Paula got the results from her Christmas exams and thankfully she passed all of them. She was really worried about one and a few others she wasn't sure of but she really didn't have anything to worry about. To celebrate we went out for a few drinks in the Pig. The [Burnley vs Spurs match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0121/burnley_tottenham.html) was on, it was the second leg of the semi final of the Carling cup, the winners would play Man United. It was an amazing match and very unlucky for Burnley.

Thursday was quiet enough. Paula was in town to pick up her phone which was being fixed only to find out that it still wasn't working. That worked out alright though as she was able to give me a lift home. There was football out at Ballinode that evening too and although we lost by a big margin at least it wasn't as cold as Monday.

Friday was our Rock Band night! It was in honour of Shelly's Birthday so we had Birthday cake and everything. It was quite a drunken night but not too bad. I think everyone had a good go at the game and everyone had a great time. I did sing "Spaceman" by The Killers and it was a bit too high for me. If "Human" was available then it probably would've turned out better. I also have to get a bit more practice with Guitar Hero as I've slipped back a bit. Once I unlock a few more songs on Guitar Hero III then I think I'll start playing songs in hard mode to get a bit more out of it.

Saturday was a lazy day. I had to get up early because Paula was heading to work but I just went back to bed and watched a few DVD's. When I got up the FA cup match between [Man United and Spurs](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0124/manchesterunited_tottenham.html) was on so I watched it. Later that evening I headed over to Paula's house to watch "The Sixth Sense". Sunday was another lazy day. I spent most of my time playing Half Life 2: Episode 2 and I think I'm nearly finished it. I don't think it's quite as good as the others but there's still a bit to go so I could change my mind.

Monday is our stock take day so that will be exciting. Plus next Friday we're heading to Neil Delamere in 'Blaney, well that is if Paula manages to find her ticket. Also my Skeletor should be arriving soon! Can't wait for that!

Paddy.
