So I was well recovered by Tuesday from my sickness, just in time to go back to work on My Birthday. Paula did come over on Monday night to watch Role Models and it was really funny. It got a bit sentimental about half way through but still worth watching. She was also going to the Doctor on Tuesday to see about the Rubella situation and she was a bit upset about that, plus I don't think I helped the situation. She did go though and even though we still didn't get any real answers at least it seems like they're actually going to do something now.

As it was my Birthday Paula came over with my present. Now I was expecting some sort of t-shirt or something like that but in she walks with this huge parcel. I hadn't a clue what it was but it turned out to be the Millennium Falcon play set that I'd been looking at for ages but never had the money to get. God only knows where Paula found the money for it either. Apparently she was a bit worried that I wouldn't like it either but that was never going to happen! That evening we went to her house to watch 'Airplane 2' and I stayed over.

Paula left me in for work on Wednesday and then headed to the dentist. Thankfully work wasn't too bad and I wasn't too tired. Adam and I watched 'Arrested Development' that evening too and we're nearly finished season two. Paula wasn't working on Thursday and nor was I so we went looking for Pamela's present in town. We then hung out in the flat for the evening. That night there was a table quiz in the Pig so we went to that and it turned out to be the [same quiz as last year](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2008/08/quizzes-drinking-and-rock-band.html), and that was when I wasn't going out with Paula! We did a bit better this time, think our score was 77, but we ended up 6th out of 16 tables. I went back to Paula's that night too.

So today we got up at about twelve and Paula wrapped her presents for Pamela and Martina. We dropped them off and we went past Garron school and they're actually ripping up the front grass and making a new drive! It looks terrible and there's hardly going to be any grass to play on. I was devastated! We then went to Stephanie's and hung out there for a while, playing with the Girls and, not so little, James. We headed back to town and had some lunch in Flemings and I got a little table to eat dinner off. We're heading out tonight to celebrate Martinas Birthday and I think we're also heading out on Sunday night for Ciara's Birthday so it's an expensive month.

Paddy.
