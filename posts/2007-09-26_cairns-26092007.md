This weekend we did some more touristy things. On Friday we rented a car and drove north, up to Port Douglas. There we stayed in a hostel called Dougies. It was really chilled out and being in a hostel again was a change but a welcome one. At least this time we didn't need our huge backpacks!
> Dougies was a really nice hostel, although we did spend quite a bit of time trying to find it. Eventually we got settled in and it was a great change of pace to meet some new people and fellow backpackers again.
 
Saturday we drove to Mossman Gorge with its many swimming holes and viewing points. It was very picturesque.
> I didn't bother going in for a swim, instead I took a good few pictures of the area. The lads did go in for a dip though. Cold but enjoyable was the verdict.

We then drove the winding coast road and over the cable ferry to Cape Tribulation. There was a beautiful, virtually unspoiled, beach next to a Dagobah like swamp. The guys went on sea kayaks while I worked on my Irish tan.
> I did take a bit of a dip in the sea here though. I don't think it was as cold as Mossman but just as enjoyable. Later we heard the stories from the Kayaking, like how difficult it is to stay upright in a two man kayak.

That evening it was back to Port Douglas for a huge steak and a few quiet ones while watching the rugby. On Sunday we went to the Port Douglas market which is like a classier version of Clogher market with extra hippy crystals and coconuts. We then had a dip in the sea at four mile beach in Port Douglas. After that we made the long trip back to Cairns, stopping off at some of the beaches along the way. We've nothing planned for next weekend so far but the weekend after that it's Powderfinger and Silverchair. Rock on!

RWC was fun while it lasted,
C'Mon Tonga!
