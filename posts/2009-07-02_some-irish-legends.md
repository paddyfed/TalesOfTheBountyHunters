On Tuesday after work and helping Edel figure out which laptop to buy, Paula came over to the flat. We were heading to Glaslough for Glaslough Villa's gala dinner thing and race night. I only realised later that it was also part of the FAI football thing thats going on at the minute in Monaghan so Paul McGrath, Ray Houghton and Packie Bonner turned up as well. The night was a great success but the speeches lasted too long and the race night was very slow to start. We only stayed for one or two races.

We went back to Paula's house and had a cup of tea and I stayed there that night too. Paula was working early the next day so we headed back into town. I was working too but only until about four and we went around town looking for a present for Daniel. We had thought of getting him a Monaghan jersey or a Ulster Rugby jersey but decided on an Ireland football jersey instead.

Thursday I was working until five and went ad bought the jersey. I headed back to the flat and helped Edel to order her laptop this time. I then headed to football and also helped Adam to carry in his new 40' TV. When I got back Adam and Shelly were watching Wall-e on Blu-Ray. We then headed down to the Shamrock to a table quiz only to find that we were a bit late. We went to McKennas instead and had a few drinks there.

Tomorrow we're on our way down to Dublin to catch the boat to the Isle of Mann hopefully for a great weekend.

Paddy.
