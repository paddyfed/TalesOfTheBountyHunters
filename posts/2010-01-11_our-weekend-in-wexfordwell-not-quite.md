So our whole plan was to head down to Wexford on Thursday evening and have the whole weekend to do whatever we wanted. Unfortunately the weather had it's own ideas! We left it that we would see how the weather was on Thursday morning and make a decision then. I had a chiropractors appointment and I was working until six but that was still time enough to head down on the bus. Unfortunately the weather only got worse! After talking about it for months, we couldn't go.

So instead we had to make the most of our weekend in Monaghan. Paula came over to the flat on Thursday night and we had spaghetti and we watched the darts. I wasn't working on Friday so we had sausages for breakfast and chilled out in the flat for a while. We saw the darts quarter final with [Chisnall and Hankey](http://www.rte.ie/sport/darts/2010/0108/darts.html) and the guys were over at it too. We got a few glimpses but not much. We then bought some things for enchiladas and we went out to Paulas house and made them there and watched the rest of the darts.

On Saturday we went out to Carolines for Niamhs party and we stayed there for a good while. She got loads of Peppa Pig things and they did a princess fashion parade for us too. We also saw the [darts semi finals](http://www.rte.ie/sport/darts/2010/0109/darts.html) which were really good. We went back to Paulas then and got ready to go out. We decided to head to the Pig and thankfully we were in early and got a good seat. We sat and chatted all night about loads of things which we hadn't done in ages and it was a really good night. We met Michael McKenna on the way back to the flat too. When we got back we had some toast and hot chocolate and went to bed.

We had planned to head back to Paulas house for dinner early but unfortunately due too an alarm clock mix-up we ended up sleeping in. We eventually got there at about two, just in time for everyone else to finish their dinner. We went to Paddys for a few things and Paula even helped behind the counter for a bit. We just sat around the house then for the day and watched the [BDO darts final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/darts/2010/0110/darts.html) and although Chisnall didn't win it was still a really exciting match. We did find out today that a pipe had burst in Paurics house though and the damage is really bad. Hopefully they'll be able to fix it quick though.

This morning Paula was back to college so she left me back into the flat. She did forget her phone though so I gave her mine for the day. I was working at one but it was quiet because of the snow. Paula went to have some allergy tests done and she came over to the flat in the evening for a Chinese dinner.

Although she's back in college I hope that we will still get to see each other a good bit. Though this time it should be a bit easier since the bookies closed down. I'm optimistic and happy which is a [big improvement over last week thankfully](/posts/2010-01-05_i-just-dont-care-anymore).
