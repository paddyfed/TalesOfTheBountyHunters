Saturday: I was working all day and when I came home I watched the [Leinster v Munster match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2010/1002/leinster_munster.html). I went to Deerys to meet up with Mark and Sarah and of course I couldn’t get a taxi home and had to get a lift with mum.

Sunday: Dad and I went to watch the Tyholland v Doohamlet match. It ended up 1-6 to 3-9. Paula came over to the house too and I attempted to tidy the room but without much success.

Monday: I was working from 11 to 4 and went looking for turkey for Paula in Flemings but didn’t have any success. I had dinner and Paula picked me up. We headed to her house and Gerard gave me a lift to football.

Tuesday: I headed out to Paulas for dinner and we went for a walk for some strenuous exercise.

Wednesday: Was working from 1 to 6 but went to the cinema in Armagh to see ‘The Other Guys’. The film was all right but it was good to get out and do something.

Thursday: I was working in the morning and got a lift home with Dad at three. I didn’t get much tidying done in the room but I headed to Paulas house for a lift to football. For once the match ended up in a draw too.

Friday: I was working today but was in a really fed up mood with it all day. I headed out to Paulas after work and saw the [Ireland vs Russia match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/1008/ireland_russia_report.html). We headed out to the Westenra for a charity ball night in aid of an Everest climb. Elaine won a ticket to Castle Leslie. Paula and I headed home early as she was working.
