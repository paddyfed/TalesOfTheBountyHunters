Had an uneventful Christmas this year which seems to be the norm with other people you talk to. I spent it at home with all of our ones, even Edel managed to make an appearance after Becks and Emma went down to Dublin to get her. Later that night we had Ken over as usual for a few drinks and a nights worth of Poker. This year we didn't have the Trivial Pursuit out though.
