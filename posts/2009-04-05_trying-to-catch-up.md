Yes, I am putting in some posts from the last few months. The reason for the gap was we moved into our new flat and we also had to wait for our broadband! I was writing it all down though and that's why I'm able to remember it all.

It shouldn't take me too long to get it all up to date.

Oh and here's a new profile picture for you.
