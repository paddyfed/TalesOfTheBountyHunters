On Friday a good mate Michael came down for a night out. I hadn't seen him since the Debs which was over six years ago so it was a nice surprise. We started off in the Pig and then moved onto the Tavern before finishing up in the Forum. Then it was back to the flat for more drunken Guitar Hero.

The next day Adam and Michelle were going to the Tavern for food so I tagged along. I then met up with Brian and Bird for an all day drinking session. We started in the Tavern where we watched the first half of Man Utd and Portsmouth in the FA Cup. We moved to the POC for the second half where we later met up with Landers who apparently had work to do earlier in the day. We then moved to the Pig where Adam, Pamela and Ashley were. We also met up with Lorraine, Ray, Aine and Bob. We just stood in the Pig all night drinking before Landers made his dive for the floor. I actually missed the event but I'm told it was dramatic.

Rang up about getting a phone line for the flat and it should be installed by the next two weeks.
