Yes so here's the full update as promised (I didn't manage to get to sleep that early by the way but I digress). So on Friday Paula was working until ten in the evening and as I knew I'd be away for most of the weekend we decided to head to the cinema. We saw Tropic Thunder which was a lot better than I imagined it would be. We also saw Flynn and Christy who just happened to be going to the same movie. After the cinema we tried to get to the Pig where Pamela, Mark, Stephanie and Adam all were but by the time the movie ended the doors were closed. So we went to Seamie's instead and had a few pints. It ended up being a bit of a later night than intended but I had to try and avoid the hangover for the morning.

Saturday was the day we headed to Kilkenny. Paula (Woosie that is) is heading off on her travels with Cathal so this was the reason for the reunion. There was a good group of us too as McHugh, Yvonne, Kat, Paula, Brady, Myself and Sweets were all down. Sweets, Sean and I landed down at about six in the evening and met up with the guys in the hostel. We went for something to eat and then started the drinking! I also had to tell everyone about my little incident with shop signs, got very little sympathy though.

We moved on to the next pub where the toilets were about three flights of stairs up. At this stage it wasn't raining that heavily either. This led to more pints and the cameras coming out. I had given my camera to Sweets as I couldn't drink and snap at the same time. We stayed here for a while and then moved on to our final pub. The details get a bit sketchy at this stage but suffice to say we had a great time in this pub too.

Anyway eventually we headed back to the hostel and somehow Paula and I got separated from the rest of the herd. So we wandered around Kilkenny, in the pouring rain, trying to find our hostel. We eventually stumbled in but not before meeting Sean on the street. So for the rest of the night we sat up drinking a few bottles of wine that Sweets managed to get, in between getting knocked down by taxis I might add. We also called Lauren in Oz for the craic and the only thing I could say to her was 'I love your boobs'. I was quite drunk at this stage mind you.

We all eventually got to bed. I somehow managed to stay in the girls dorm, don't ask me how. I think I just passed out and they took advantage of me. We all got up at ten on Sunday, severely hungover. After breakfast we had to say our goodbyes and headed home. We all said we should do it again when Landers gets back sometime in mid November. It was a fantastic night though and hopefully Paula and Cathal will have a great time on their travels.

Paddy.
