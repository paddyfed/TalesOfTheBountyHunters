It's been so long since I've updated the Australian portion of this blog that it's actually catching up on me. The next date that I need to update is 21/01/2007, almost exactly a year ago!!! So basically I need to do a bit more on that otherwise I'll just forget about it and never finish it. Trying to remember things from a year ago can be a bit difficult after all. Now that my PC is up and running though it might be a bit easier.

Monday I was playing football in Gortakeegan and it was absolutely freezing. It basically snowed for a good half hour and unless you were constantly moving you started to go numb.  After about five minutes I couldn't feel my hands!! We eventually lost by a good margin but I didn't care in the end. I was just glad it was over. After that we went to the Pig to watch the second half of the [Liverpool vs Everton match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0119/liverpool_everton.html). The 1-1 draw leaves Man United top of the league and with still a game in hand! Also who ever thought that this would ever happen? [Wishful thinking from the Man City fans I think](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0119/kaka.html).
