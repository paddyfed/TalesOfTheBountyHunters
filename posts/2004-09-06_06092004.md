Got my hair cut at last. I can't remember the last time I did get it cut. I have a feeling it was in May but I don't know if it was before or after the exams. Either way my hair was longer than it had been since I was in secondary school. But it's all gone now.

Just came back from a week up in Donegal as well. I went up for the week just to have a bit of craic. I have to say that it was an excellent week. We started out in the Grill on Sunday then Sister Sara's on Tuesday and the Orchard on Wednesday. It was really good to get back to Letterkenny, so good in fact that I'll be going up next week too for a 21st. Sometimes it's easy to realise why you enjoyed college so much and weeks like that are the best example of it. God only knows if I'll ever get that anywhere else that I go.

My computer is starting to act up a bit. It's not too bad at the moment but there is a strange noise coming out of somewhere and have yet to rule out the computer as a source. Also the Internet connection is slower than normal so I'm currently checking for spy ware. On top of all that my nephew tried to install a game on the old computer and messed it up so that'll have to be fixed too. I guess that's what you get for going away for a week.
