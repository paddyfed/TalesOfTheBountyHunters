Happy Australia Day (well it was a few days ago but I was drinking!). Yep, time to celebrate everything Australian which, surprisingly, doesn't really involve drinking. At least not to the same extent as Paddy's day. But anyway the week started off well when we went out for a few drinks on Tuesday in the Junction and it ended up being just a few drinks too thankfully! Friday we had a film crew in the office. They were taking shots for a corporate video thing to be shown at our get-together thing in February. So there's my first, and last, foray into acting.
> Some of the people in the office were interviewed about the merger thing and thankfully I wasn't picked! Although they did use some of the footage that me and another guy, Joel, were helping them out with. Just some random point and look at things type stuff. Very exciting!

We didn't go out that night, saving ourselves for the big weekend. Saturday we went walkabouts in the City. There was loads of activities and bands playing but we made our way to McQuarie St for the vintage car show. Loads of them about.
> It was a really nice day too and I think we all got a bit burned but it wasn't too bad. There was a flyby by a fighter jet too over the harbour bridge. We went to the rocks to watch that though. It was so loud!

We were going to go to a concert in the Domain but decided against it in the end and just went to the pub instead (333 bar, only half evil!). Odie flew back in at about six in the evening but we were soon off again to watch the fireworks at Darling Harbour. Great stuff.
> There was also this big ship thing that sailed into the harbour that was all lit up. It was really cool. We couldn't actually get in to Darling Harbour though and we also had a bit of bother trying to get out and go to PJ's!

It was off to PJ's after that before making our way to Empire at Kings Cross. PJ's good, Empire not so good.
> Afterwards we all said that we should have stayed in PJ's. It wasn't the last time we made that mistake though. Empire wasn't too bad but it just isn't a great night club. Terrible music and ignorant bouncers just doesn't add up to a good night out. We did mess about with some guys crutches though, that was funny.

Sunday we started off early enough. After a few drinks in the Junction we went to 'Durty Nelly's' in Paddington for a few Guinness. We then came home to get changed and went into Darling Harbour again. We didn't manage to get to a night club though and a lot of places were closing up quite early.
> Imagine if there was a bank holiday Monday in Ireland, places would actually be opening up and not closing their doors. Seems they do the opposite in Australia, not one night club was open late in Darling Harbour and we definitely weren't going back to Kings Cross!

Monday was as sick as a dog so that was a washout! It's Odie's last week in OZ so we'll have to do something special for her leaving. We still haven't even brought her to see the sights around the city so it'll be an action packed weekend next time.

Time for some touristy stuff,
Paddy.
