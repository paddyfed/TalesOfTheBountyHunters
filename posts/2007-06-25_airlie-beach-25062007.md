So we've arrived at Airlie Beach after a few days tough travelling. We stopped in Noosa first which was nice but very quiet (which seems to be a theme around these parts). Everything seems to close down by about 8 in the evening so not much partying.

> We stayed in the Koala beach resort in Noosa if I remember correctly and it was crap. I think it  was the first time that we had been in a large dorm and the place was just rotten. We spent most of our time in a nearby Irish bar who also had great Guinness. After a few pints we went to this pizza place for something to eat but they were closing up. They did make us a pizza but they seemed to just lump all their leftovers onto it so it wasn't great.

From Noosa we headed back down the coast to see the sights and thankfully it was a good day.
> From what I remember we were in Maroochydore, Mooloolaba, where we had a drink in the Surf Club, and Caloundra.

We then stayed at Rainbow beach which was even quieter than Noosa. However we did find this pub which was selling beers for $3 (which is about â‚¬1.80) so we stayed there for the night.

> Rainbow beach was actually quite nice, even if it was quiet. It turned out to be a RSL club that we stayed in. Of course we had no idea what a RSL club was. We found out later that they are clubs that were set up for returning servicemen from the wars. That's probably why they had cheap beer.

The next day we made our way to Yeppoon near Rockhampton. There we found a hippie gathering, they were protesting against the war in Iraq or something, which was bizarre. We stayed in a room attached to a camp-site which was filled with old people so not much craic there either. Was a great room though.

> Yeppoon was nice too. It seemed to be a good place to go out for a few drinks. The camp-site was also the best room that we stayed in all the way up the east coast. Oh and we heard the best joke ever. What goes next to yer knife and yer fork? Yeppoon. Hilarious.

Now that we're on Airlie beach, and cause we're staying here for a few days, we can finally relax and go out on a proper night out. Hopefully the weather will get better though.
