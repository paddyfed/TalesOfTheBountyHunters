205kWh generated in November so the lowest amount yet. Same with 18kWh as the export. Probably not too bad but it's also the first month that the total imported has exceeded the total generated. Expect the same until March next year. I've also started charging the car at night (between 2 and 4 AM) as I'm planning on changing the current electricity plan that we are on to take advantage of very cheap (0.13c) price at that time. So you can see that reflected in the total and average power imported at that time.

The price per kWh continues to lower.
