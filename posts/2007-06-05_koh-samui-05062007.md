So we've moved to Koh Samui. It's not as relaxed as Koh Phanghan but not as crazy as Bangkok. Sort of a mix of the two. The beach here is just fantastic though. It's like one of those beaches you see on holiday brochures. The lads went on some jet skis today and it looked pretty class. I'll probably try them at some stage.

> When the guys were on the jet skis I was on the beach, looking after the stuff and generally taking pictures of the scenery. I did try to take pictures of the lads on the water but as it turned out I was taking pictures of some other guys on their jet skis. Don't tell anyone though!

Just get me to a bungee jump or a ski-diving site and then we'll have the excitement. Mui Thai, get the seat earlier. Get the seat earlier!

> Heard all over Koh Samui and Koh Phangan. It's their advertising for the Thai boxing. Get the seat earlier or you'll miss out, I guess.

We found this Irish bar that does a great Ulster Fry with Fadge and Soda and all!

> The pub was called Tropical Murphy's of all things.

We're going to find another pub so we can get drunk and find some women to talk to (no not lady-boys, but a few have been spotted!)

Be cool,
Paddy.
