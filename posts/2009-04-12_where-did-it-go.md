On Saturday I was in the flat for most of the day and Paula came over during her lunch break to say hello and to get out of work for an hour or so. That was grand, she came over we watched a few episodes of South Park and she went back to work. Unfortunately she called about ten minutes later asking if I'd seen her wallet. She had lost it somewhere between work and the flat and she couldn't find it.

No big deal you think but she had her keys in it and all of her cards. So she had to cancel all her cards and we searched up and down the street for the wallet to hopefully find the keys. No luck. Paula was quite upset about it as well. She nearly wasn't going to go out that night either. I finally convinced her to come along and we went to the Pig to meet Ciara. It was packed in there though, you really couldn't move in the place. So we decided to head over to the West to meet with Steph and Adam. Martina was there too and thankfully it wasn't as full.

After the west we went to the Seasons for the first time in a long time and we had a really good night. I met up with a few people that I hadn't seen in a long time. Paula drove us all home after that. Oh earlier in the day Adam and I watched the [Sunderland vs United match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0411/sunderland_manutd.html) on the computer. Just as we got the picture Sunderland scored, great timing eh?
