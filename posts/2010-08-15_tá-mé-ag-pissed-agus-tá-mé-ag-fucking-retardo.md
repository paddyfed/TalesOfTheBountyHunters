So on Friday, after all of the messing around and not knowing exactly what was going on, Paul picked me and Adam up from the flat and drove down to Newbridge where Keith brought us the rest of the way to Cork. We had a few cans on the way down and when we arrived we went straight to the bar. There was also this kid in the bar who called Paul a gobshite so he was cool.

When the other guys arrived we booked into the hotel and got all the rooms sorted and headed out on the town. We tried to get into a few clubs after being in a few pubs but not with much success. The one club we did get into was a bit empty to say the least. We eventually got back to the hotel.

I wasn't up too early on Saturday and we watched a bit of the [Man City and Spurs match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0814/tottenham_mancity.html). We then met the rest of the guys in a pub down town and sat drinking for a while. There were so many stories being told and they were hilarious. We went back to the hotel and had something to eat and some karaoke and then went out on the town again. This time we were a bit more successful with getting into a club.

When we decided to leave, after getting a kebab, we went back to the hotel and sat drinking until around four in the morning when they eventually stopped serving. That didn't stop us heading up to the room in an attempt to disturb Keith. This was when he came up with the title of this post.

We were up and out of the room by twelve and we were going to stay and watch the [Liverpool and Arsenal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0815/liverpool_arsenal.html) but we had something to eat and decided to head home instead. Paula came over to the flat too when we got back and we had a Monte for dinner. Even after all the messing leading up to the weekend I'm glad I went and it was a great weekend.

Paddy.
