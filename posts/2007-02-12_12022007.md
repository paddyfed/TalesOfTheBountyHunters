Went out with Brian for a days drinking on Saturday. We watched the Man Utd game in the POC before moving to McKennas to eat our Monty chips. We then met up back in McKennas where we sat in the corner drinking the night away.

Went home to watch the [Ireland vs France Rugby game](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2007/0211/ireland3.html) and what a disappointment. I thought we had it with the last penalty only for France to come down and score a try to win it.
