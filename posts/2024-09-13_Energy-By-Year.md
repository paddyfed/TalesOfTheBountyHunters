I've added a new section to the nav menu. It's a chart which compares the energy production and usage of the house over the last year. I've added it using [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) instead of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) because I couldn't get the grouping working the way I liked on Chart.js. Maybe someday I will either return to Chart.js to see if I can get it working or convert all the other charts to ApexCharts instead. I did enjoy working wih ApexCharts, to me it was a bit easier to understand. I may just try their donut charts too and see if they are any easier to work with.

On the job front, still no luck with anything. However I will be starting a course in Monaghan Institute on Monday. It's a Digital Marketing traineeship so it's all about content and media creation. I've no idea if it will lead to any jobs but it should still be interesting.
