Paula had a scope on Tuesday so I went and met her at the hospital and sat with her for a while. She was grateful but I had to go to work at one. It all went well and she was a bit out of it afterwards. Gerard gave me a lift out to the house after I was finished work. Paula left me into town next morning for work and I was in a really fed up mood for some reason. We left our Father's day present out to Dad that evening in an attempt to cheer me up. I was still in a foul mood even after football on Thursday and I did take it out on Paula which I shouldn't have.

It was Ashleys leaving party in McKennas on Friday evening and we were all out upstairs. I was quite tired though and thankfully we didn't stay too late in the night. Emma was there too as Jade was heading off to England and it was her leaving do too. Emma sat talking to Philip all night. When we got back to Paulas house I didn't feel too well but thankfully I wasn't too sick.

On Saturday it was Edels 21st party in Kingscourt so we headed up to it. It was a really good night too. They had a marquee and a barbecue and there was even brush dancing! I met Sean for the first time too and his sister and her boyfriend who live in 'Blayney. They were all really sound and hopefully we'll all get out together again soon. We eventually got home around four in the morning. On Sunday I headed back to town to watch the [England match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0627/germany_england.html) and what a result that was. Paula also headed to the [Monaghan match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0627/fermanagh_monaghan.html) in Cavan and they're through to an Ulster final! They picked me up on the way back home and I nearly forgot the ice cream!

Monday it lashed rain but thankfully it cleared up for football. We are always quite lucky in that way! Tuesday Paula came over to the flat and we made dinner and then headed out to Paurics house for a visit and to see the end of the [Spain and Portugal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0629/spain_portugal.html). We made dinner in Paulas house on Wednesday but unfortunately she didn't feel well afterwards and went to bed early.

Thursday was football day again and this time the ball hit me on my left thigh and left a massive bruise to match the one on my right calf. My knees and legs felt really sore after that! I wasn't working on Friday so we watched the [Brazil and Holland match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0702/brazil_netherlands.html), me in my Brazil top and Adam in his Holland one. Paula came over to the flat after work and we headed to her house and then went bowling in 'Blayney with Ciara and her niece. We also managed to see the [Uruguay and Ghana match go to penalties](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0702/uruguay_ghana.html). Paula stayed in the flat that night.

For once I was working on Saturday and it was Paulas turn to stay in bed. Becky was coming back on the bus from Dublin so we sat and watched the [Germany and Argentina match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0703/argentina_germany.html) in the flat. Paula came over again and we headed out to her house for dinner. We watched the [Spain and Paraguay match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/worldcup/2010/0703/spain_paraguay.html) and we watched a few DVDs, 'Planet 51' and 'Zonad'. They were both good but not brilliant.

I got up on Sunday and again I was in a fed up mood and really tired. This time it was because I didn't really get a good sleep but it was still annoying. I went home for dinner around six and a few MOTUC figures were waiting for me namely She-Ra, Keldor and Faker. So now I only have King Grayskull to get to complete the figures I missed out on. This brings us to today and I was working this morning but it went quick, just a hardware count and a few faulty returns. Paula is coming over for a walk as I'm not going to football. My knees are just too sore at the minute and to be honest I'm just not bothered. Hopefully a rest will rejuvenate me.

Paddy.
