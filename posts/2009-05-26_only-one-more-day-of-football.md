For the first time I think ever I played football, scored in the match (twice I might add) and actually won! So that was a great surprise. We didn't do much on Friday, Paula was working and I went down to say hello again. We went for a pizza after that too and took it back to the flat. It was really nice too which surprised me. Pizza D'or have some stiff competition.

Saturday I was at work for the afternoon and headed straight to the pub to watch the [Heineken Cup final between Leicester and Leinster](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2009/0523/leinster_leicester.html). It was a really close contest and Leinster just held out at the end to finally end their Heineken Cup duck. When the match finished I headed back to the flat and had a montie for dinner. Paula came over at about nine and we headed out to the Hillgrove. It was Sinead Kellys wedding and we were invited to the evening part (well I should say Paula was invited and I tagged along). It was a really good night too. We sat talking to Ciara, Fiona and her husband Brendan. Caroline and Kevin were there too but they headed home early.

We got home at about half three. Paula stayed in the flat as she was working on Sunday. For me Sunday was a bit of a lazy day. I sat on the couch and watched the [Monaco GP](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/0524/buttonj.html) and the [Derry and Monaghan match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0524/derry_monaghan.html). Two terrible results by the way! I did head home for dinner but I actually slept for most of the evening.

On Monday it was back to work but there was some good news! Adam is coming back to work and he was back in the flat on Monday evening. It'll be a bit weird having someone back in the flat but I'm sure we'll get back into a rhythm. Today was just another boring day at work. We were supposed to have our stock take but it's been postponed until the 7th of June which means I'll probably miss James' Christening. Also tomorrow is the final of the Champions League and I'm really looking forward to it. I'm not that nervous though as I'm not really that concerned about winning. The league was the most important thing this year!

Paddy.
