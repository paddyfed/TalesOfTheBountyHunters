Woooo It's Friday 13th and bad things are gonna happen. Not last cause we're heading out tonight. We might go to this Ministry of Sound sessions tour thing that's on in the casino but I don't think anything has been decided. We'll at least be in a few pubs around the city.

> I think this was around the time that we started our weekend tradition of going to PJ's for pints and then going to the Woolshed for even more. PJ's is a really great pub, by the way. Not just because they have the Coyote Ugly dancing on the bar but it's just a great place to have the craic. Our usual spot was up on the stage bit at the back where we could watch the GAA and where it wasn't too busy.

Oh yea and next Saturday (for my birthday, ahem) myself and Landers will be throwing ourselves out of a plane, hopefully (and hopefully with a parachute). That should be fun. The job search has started but there doesn't seem to be much about other than working in bars and the like.

> Yea that's more like I remember it.

But I suppose that wouldn't be so bad seeing as it'll only be temporary.

Let you know how we get on,
Paddy.
