This week has been pretty good if fairly uninteresting. Aside from the usual football on Monday Paula and I have gone out walking a good bit. Tuesday we walked in town out to the 24hr shop and back. We went to Paulas house afterwards though and we watched some of 'The Mighty Boosh' before falling asleep on the couch. On Wednesday we went walking in Glaslough but the back road was too slippery so we just did a short circuit around the village.

We also made dinner out there, stir fry with black bean sauce, and watched TV for the rest of the evening. I was working from one to nine today because I had to swap hours with Emma so that I could go to Denis' 50th party tomorrow evening. We'll be leaving the house around six and it should be good craic.

Oh yea, [I didn't see it](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0204/meteorite.html) but I wish I had! Paula also got the invites printed on Wednesday. They were a bit smaller than the first ones we printed but thankfully all of the writing was still on them.
