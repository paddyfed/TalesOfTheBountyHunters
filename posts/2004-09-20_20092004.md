One day to go until the Star Wars Trilogy DVD is released. Even though I think it's out on Monday, I probably won't be able to get it until Tuesday or Wednesday when I might get a lift into town. Dunno where I'm gonna buy it yet though. I could try Tescos or Xtra-Vision, I suppose it'll depend which is cheaper and what condition the box is in. I've also been trying to download the latest Making of Episode III Webdoc but have been unsuccessful so far, but tonight it seems to be going a lot quicker so I'm hopeful!!!

I might be creating a web site for Treanor Stone-Tec here in Monaghan. Nothing is certain yet but fingers crossed that I'll be able to create something to their liking. Updates as I get them.
