Not a bad weekend by all accounts. We went for a few drinks in the Tea Gardens on Friday night which was the first time in a while that we went out on a Friday night. Wasn't a bad night, especially when Darren decided to steal the Guinness poster from the wall.
> That was so funny, he tried to sneak it down by pulling it off the wall only for the blu-tac on the top to come off first. The poster then flopped down over his head for a few seconds before he hastily rolled it up and put it away. Laughed my ass off!

Saturday we went to Manly beach for a bit of a paddle and a surf. The weather held up too which was great. Manly is a nice enough town but the beach needs a bit of a clean. It was a good day anyway. That night we went to PJ's for a few drinks. We then went to Mansions in King's Cross but had to leave for undisclosed reasons.
> Ok the reason was that I had forgotten my ID and I knew rightly that they wouldn't let me in, they're a bit strict like that over there! So the rest of them went in and I was left outside for a few minutes. When the lads realised that I wasn't there they came out and had a bit of a 'discussion' with the bouncers and we were all kicked out. Good times!

We did go to a better pub though 'Madame DeBeers' which actually has quite nice Guinness on tap. The guy behind the bar was trying to tell me to let the Guinness settle before drinking it (yea I know, I just don't want to stand at the bar for ages especially as I'd already been waiting five minutes). We managed to get home at about five in the morning but not before being rained on! Next week who knows what but the Rugby is back on so I'm sure that will be the main event.

100 days left,
