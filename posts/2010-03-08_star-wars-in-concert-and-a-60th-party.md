On Wednesday we went for a walk in Glaslough for the first time in a while and for some reason my shins were really sore, really tight and they never really losened up but it was still a good walk and we even did a bit of running at the end too. Thursday Dad called me at work to see if he could get some help with the new routeer they installed at work but he didn't need me that evening anyway. Paula also wanted us to do up a poster for the donations at Seans party though I couldn't this evening because of the football.

On Friday it was Nicolas birthdy too so Paul went out and got her a cake and we sang happy brthday to her when she almost found it in the fridge. That evening I headed out to Paulas and we made the poster for the donations, it came out alright too. We then watched the Late Late Show for the evening (yes sad, I know) and we chatted about things for the rest of the night.

On Saturday we got up and headed over to Carolines as it was Ciaras Birthday too. She was having a bit of a party and I basically spent my time running around the house after all the kids. We then headed back into town to help put up the decorations in the West but we couldn't because the room wasn't free. The rest of them went home and I went to the flat to get ready. When we got back to the West they had put up all the decorations for us which was great and then we could enjoy the evening. Mum and Dad came in too and Emma waited around for a while too. It was a really good night and we danced for ages. Mark, Brian and Marie made an appearance too which was really great to see them. We eventually got a taxi home at about half three and went to bed at four in the morning. They raised about &euro;1,800 in donations!

On Sunday Shelly picked me up from Paulas and we headed down to Dublin for the Star Wars in Concert. I headed to the flat first and had lunch with Edel and Becky and then we headed off to the O2. There were a load of movie props and people dressed up. The Darth Vader was impressive but Darth Maul looked a bit pudgy. No matter though as we found our seats in good time and were joined by Adam, Shelly and Jade. I really had goosebumps when it started and I was so impressed with the event. I think alot of it was the same as the Episode III soundtrack bonus DVD but I've yet to find that out. We headed back to town on the Luas and got a bus back to the car. I did buy a t-shirt and Jade bought a cool Lightsaber that flashed and it was a really great night and well worth the &euro;80 for the ticket.

It was back to earth today and back to work and although we lost in football this evening it was still a great match. The next thing we have to look forward to is Gift Grub at the end of April and I can't wait to head off to Fanad in a few weeks!

Paddy.
