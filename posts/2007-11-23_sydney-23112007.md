Well it's been a while since I've updated here, bad Paddy! This may be a long one. Last Friday as I said before, we had to move out of 'Wake Up!' hostel because it was booked up. We went to a place called '790 On George' which turned out to be cheaper and a bit nicer than 'Wake Up!' so it worked out well. Although there was only four saucepans in the kitchen so cooking was difficult. 
> The rooms in this hostel at least were a lot nicer than Wake Up! although the huge amount of stairs that you had to climb were ridiculous. Either that or wait half an hour for the tiny lift.

We stayed in that night much to the disappointment of the girls. On Saturday we went house hunting again in Coogee and Edgecliff, saw some dives, it wasn't nice. But that day we found out that we were accepted into another flat that the lads viewed earlier in the week. 
> We did see one nice flat in Edgecliff but there was no chance that we were going to get it. The landlord didn't seem interested in us whatsoever. We were in Coogee when we found out, just outside the CBH. We met up wth Paul and Ali there too.

It's in Bondi Junction so the location is fantastic. That night we went out celebrating in 'PJ O'Briens' as it was also Paul's birthday. Duff even came down from the Gold Coast for a visit much to the lads surprise. That night was a bit messy as we ended up in Scruffy Murphy's again. Lots of interesting photos from that night! 
> I think this is in reference to a photo that was taken of that night in which it appears that Paul and I have a bit of an intimate moment. Let me just say that it was good for me.

Sunday, after recovering from the hangover, we went to the landlord to finalise the flat and get the keys. Then it was over to the 'Tea Gardens' in Bondi Junction for our now traditional Sunday drinks. After watching a Chilli Peppers tribute downstairs, oh and sorting out the 'rules', we went to Scruffy Murphy's again! That has to stop soon! We didn't stay too long though, thankfully. That was another messy night! 
> The rules, by the way, were quite complicated and I'm not sure I ever fully understood them but the gist was that we had so many opportunities to veto a night out with the girls if we wanted. I don't think it was ever used that much and the rules didn't last too long either.

Monday we left the hostel, hopefully for the last time, and made our way to our new bachelor pad. It's not huge but it's bigger than the lads led me to believe, and as I said before the location is great, even if we don't have a bathroom door yet. The rest of the week has been relatively quiet. We went out on Wednesday to the 'Cock and Bull' in the Junction for a few with the girls, which turned into a few more. I had to go home, however, cause of the 'work' thing, which is going fine by the way. My huge cold that I can't get rid of doesn't help things though. This weekend we'll be going out again but we're going to try and find a proper club to go to and no more 'Scruffy Murphys' please!

Get curtain's drawn,
Paddy.
