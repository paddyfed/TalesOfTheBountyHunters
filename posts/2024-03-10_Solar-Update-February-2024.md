Energy generated in February has gone up as expeted over January, helped by a couple of sunny days in the middle of the month. We also got our latest bill which is for €99.08 between 4 January and 4 March 2024. This does include a Government subsidy of €150 though so it should really be about €250. We also managed to export about 67kWh back to the grid.
