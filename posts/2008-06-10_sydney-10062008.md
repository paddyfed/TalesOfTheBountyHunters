So this is my last post from Australia. Tomorrow I'll be headed back to the Emerald Isle via Singapore, Frankfurt and a weekend away in Liverpool. The flight over from Christchurch was grand too. Didn't have any problems in customs even though my visa is due to run out in about two days time. Anyway. The only thing left to do is to tie up a few loose ends and pack the backpack for hopefully the last time, well for a while anyway. It's been a good year. The times that stick out most in my mind are the Full Moon on Thailand, the Skydive over Mission Beach, the many mad nights out in Sydney, Christmas back home and surprising everyone, New Years eve at Circular Quay, Paddy's Day in the Mercantile, Nights out in the Tea Bags, the trip to Uluru and New Zealand and especially the Bungy jump! If anything else springs to mind I guess I'll say it later. After I finish reading this blog thingy from start to finish that is. You never know I might remember stuff that I forgot to mention first time around :D

2 days left and I'll see you in Monaghan, Dublin or Liverpool,
Paddy.
