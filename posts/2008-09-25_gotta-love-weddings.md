Yep last Friday was Marie-Therese and Gareths wedding up in Portstewart and it was a fantastic day out. It's the first wedding that we were all at since Grainnes wedding a few years ago. Of course my big news was the state of my hand and I had to explain the story about a hundred times that day. The food was fantastic, thanks goes to Becky for cutting up my dinner, and the band that played were really good. Thankfully everyone got up to dance and didn't do the 'sit in the corner and look bored' thing that sometimes happens. I did manage to miss out on YMCA though, and it wasn't like I planned it either, it was just a happy coincidence. The dance didn't last too long into the night, I think it was about two when we were leaving, but we were all sufficiently drunk anyway so that didn't matter. We stayed in Eileen and Joes house that night and they all came back home at 12 the next day.

Me and the girls didn't stay though. They were heading out to see the Mighty Boosh and I was heading to Emers 21st. I didn't head out to the house though, instead I met up with Paula, Stephanie and Pamela in the Pig. I eventually met up with the GAME guys in the Forum and had a few drinks with them there. Was good craic to get out with them again but I wasn't half as drunk as most of them so we'll have to do it properly next time.

Sunday I met up with Adam and Johnny in the Pig, again, for a few pints. We didn't stay long as we went down to the Poc to watch a live band playing there. I'm beginning to like the Poc a bit more but I still prefer the Pig, I think. Anyway, Adam headed home after that cause he was working but Johnny and I decided it would be a good idea to head to the Forum. Last time that happened I managed to injure myself. Thankfully nothing as serious this time although I did manage to break a girls bracelet while jiving with her! She wasn't impressed as you can imagine.

Not much else of note this week. I was down in Dublin on Tuesday and Wednesday to get the stitches out of my finger. It's healing nicely and they're happy with the movement in it so it's all going well. Ill be able to take the bandages off in a few days but the splint will have to stay for another few weeks. Also my PC is out of commission due to the extension lead going bang. So no photos for the minute, I'll have them up when I get the chance.

Update: Photos are now up.

Paddy.
