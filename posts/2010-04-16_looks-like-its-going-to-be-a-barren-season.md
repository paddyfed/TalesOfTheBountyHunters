So a [bad result last night](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0407/manchesterunited.html) and I was working late on Thursday too so no football either. Paula did make dinner for me though which was nice but she's not feeling too well at the minute which is not so good, think it's a bit of a flu though so nothing too bad.

I wasn't working on Friday either so I lazed about in Paulas house. The kids were over for a while too so I entertained myself with them. James especially, he's just class. Paula left me home in the evening as I was working on Saturday for the first time in a long time. It was absolutely dead though. Ben was over in the flat for a while too for a few drinks. They were heading out but I headed out to Paulas house instead. We watched TV and played the Sims for a while.

On Sunday Caroline was taking the girls to a Disney play in Belfast so we looked after James for a while. It was such a nice day we took him on a walk to the park and had him on the swings and down the slide too. When they came back Paula took me out home for my dinner and she stayed a while. I showed her around Nanas although it is looking a bit old at this stage.

Monday I wasn't up too early but I did have to work and we had football in the evening but it wasn't great as we won far too easily in the end. Ger did have a bit of a run in with the razor though and he had to hide it under his cap. On Tuesday I was at work again but headed out to Paulas for dinner. We looked after the kids for a while and made enchiladas and everyone was impressed by them. Paula made turkey burgers and they were nice but the burger buns didn't come out just right. We just relaxed in front of the TV after that.

Wednesday Paula came over to the flat and we had our curry for dinner. We watched Waterloo Road for some reason, laziness I think, but then we watched Episode III so Paula has now seen all of the Star Wars movies. She does think she needs to see them all again soon though as she can't really remember what happened in most of them.

Paula had a back appointment on Thursday so we were up early. We were expecting David to show up at work too but he didn't in the end. I headed straight to football after work too and it was an epic! We were losing for all of the match, and quite convincingly, but we managed to win 25-24 in the end. I chatted to Paula on the phone for a while when I got home and she didn't have a great day at college. It was James birthday today too, it's hard to believe a year has gone by already.

So I was in work again today but it went quickly and Paula is coming over to the flat now too.

Paddy.
