So I headed out to Pualas house on Friday and I had bought all the stuff for a stir-fry. Paula really wasn't feeling the best though so we lay down on the couch in the sitting room for a while. She eventually fell asleep and I got up to make the dinner. We then sat on the couch for the rest of the evening, playing The Sims and doing the crossword.

Sean was leaving me in to work in the morning so I didn't really get a good nights sleep. I was too worried about sleeping in! I was at work all day too but I spent most of my time changing light bulbs and trying to fix one of the security cameras.

Paula and Elaine picked me up after work and we headed out to Martinas house to give her a present. We stayed for a while chatting but this meant that we couldn't make the turkey fillets that we wanted. Instead we went back to town and got a take-away. We did the crossword again and watched a bit of TV and eventually went to bed.I lay down on Paulas bed for a while before eventually moving to the couch though I really wanted to stay there all night.

So I woke up this morning and watched the [Hungarian Grand Prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2010/0801/webberm_hungary.html). We also went for a walk through the village and saw some of the goings on at the fete. We even went back in for a proper nosey and the talent contest was interesting. We didn't stay too long and Paula left me out home for dinner. Now I'm back in the flat listening to the bank holiday crowd heading into the forum.

Tomorrow I'm not working but I'll be busy as Mo-Larr and Orko are both being released at about five in the evening. Hopefully it will be another successful day!

Paddy.
