I'm fed up with people being stupid and annoying. I'm at the point now that I just don't care what people think or what they're doing or what a fantastic New Year they had or even if it was shit, I just don't care! I'm especially fed up with people treating me like I'm an idiot or telling me what to do even if I've done things a thousand times before or treating me like I have no common sense!

And assuming things too like I've been hammered all over Christmas and that's how I've hurt my back or that I'm somehow faking it in an elaborate plot to get Monday off work. Yea I really wanted to stay in A&E for five hours in the freezing cold with Mum, Dad and Paula sitting beside me. Yea this was the plan all along and that whole sitting doing nothing on New Years Eve while everyone else drank and had a good time, that was part of the plan too. Ingenious isn't it?

All I want is to be left alone so that I can chill and have a nice relaxing time in front of the TV. Drink in one hand, Paula in the other, relaxing and having a good time. Adam is away in two weeks so maybe I'll chill out then and hopefully we can actually get down to Wexford this weekend.

By the way, could everyone else just fuck off? Is that too much to ask?

Paddy.
