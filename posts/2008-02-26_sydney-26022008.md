So just over 100 days left in this little adventure (well according to the countdown on my profile page anyway) so we've started to organise some activities for the weekends.
> At this stage we hadn't really done any touristy things in Sydney and we were really running out of time. Thankfully we had jobs that were Monday to Friday which meant that we could organise things for every weekend.

We went up to Palm Beach on Saturday which was really good. It's a lovely beach and we got to see the surf club from 'Home and Away' which was cool. It was a really nice day too. The lads went surfing which apparently was great fun! Kat and I occupied ourselves by making some sand boobies (it did start off innocently enough mind you).
> We were going to make a big sandcastle but we didn't have any buckets or spades so we made these two mounds and they ended up looking like big boobies so we made a sand lady to go with them.

We went to the golf club for a few drinks before getting on the longest bus journey ever back to the city.
> This was also the journey we were taking that Paula nearly missed the bus going up. She had been out the night before and was a bit late getting to George Street to get the bus. So Me and Kat waited on her while the rest of the gang headed on. It was funny stuff especially as Paula was still a little drunk!

That night it was the [Ireland vs Scotland match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2008/0223/ireland_scotland.html) in the rugby so we went out to watch that. We couldn't get into Cargo Bar however (guest list my ass) so we were going to go to PJ's. It was full though so we went to Kings Cross to see if we could find a pub there. We ended up in "O'Malleys" which I thought we'd never been in but as it turns out we were there with Pedro, Dawn et all the first week we were here. We then went to Mansions to watch the Rugby. Craig, who works with the lads, was there but he wasn't too impressed with the final score. We finally got home at about six in the morning so it was a good night.
> Yea the first time we were in "O'Malleys" we didn't really know where we were, and we especially didn't know we were in Kings Cross. Once we realised that it was actually an OK place we started heading there a bit more. Oh and we really had to fight to stay in Mansions to watch the end of the Rugby. They were ready to kick us out for closing with about fifteen minutes left but we convinced them to let us stay.

In other news, saw Jumper last Tuesday. It's billed as 'The Matrix meets Bourne' but it's not as good as either of those movies. It's probably a wait for DVD movie really. Next week we plan to go to Manly beach via the ferry so hopefully we'll have good weather for that too. Also there's been talk of a barbecue (our first since leaving Cairns) so we'll see how that goes.

107 days left,
Paddy.
