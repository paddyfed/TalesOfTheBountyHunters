So we're still in Sydney and it's not stopped raining! That's one thing you were never warned about! It's still ok though. We've just been continuing our drinking adventure. Mostly we've been going down to the pub called the 'Tea Gardens' and staying there although we have on a few occasions gone down to another pub called 'Scruffy Murphys' which as you might guess is an Irish pub.

> Unfortunately this wasn't the last time we went to Scruffy's. The reason I hate it so much is probably for a few reasons. Firstly I think I've only ever had one really good night in it. Second it's not a very good pub, it suffers from cattle market syndrome. Third, the bouncers are the most ignorant people you're ever likely to meet. Anyway...go to a happy place. Oh we never made it to the Cock and Bull because it was closed for renovations as I recall.

We've been staying with a few ones that Landers knows from college and one of the guys happens to be Rory Treanor who we went to the Sem with. We haven't done any tourist things yet because it's just been to damn wet, oh and hangovers are a bitch! We did see Bondi beach though.

> Bondi Beach is not a nice place on a cold and wet day, just in case you were wondering.

Still when we come back in a few months time the weather should be better. We're heading to Brisbane tomorrow by plane and we'll hire a camper van for the rest of the trip to Cairns.

> The plan did change slightly but I'm glad we didn't get a camper in the end. Besides Landers would never have fitted into it.

Still no mobile number but I'm working on it.

Come to Sydney, catch a cold,
Paddy.
