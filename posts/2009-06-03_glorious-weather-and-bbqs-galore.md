I was working on Friday but thankfully we still managed to see some of the great weather that arrived for the weekend. We headed out to Stephanie's house for a few drinks and to play a bit of pool. We ended up watching 'Britain's got Talent' too but thankfully it wasn't on for that long. We just headed back to the flat after that. I was working on Saturday too as Neil had the day off due to the FA Cup Final. It was an uneventful day and Paula came over to the flat after work to get ready. She was heading to Carrick to go out with Edel and a few of her friends as she was heading to Chicago on Monday. Adam and I played Rock Band for the rest of the night which was a good blast from the past.

On Sunday we headed home for a while as Mum wanted us to pick up some posters for a raffle she is involved in. Eamonn and Patricia were there too. We headed back to town though as we were getting a lift to Landers' for a barbecue. It was Sara's Birthday and so we had a few drinks and some great food out in the sunshine. We then headed back to town and into the Pig before ending up in the Forum. It was a really good night too. We headed back to the flat after the night club, bit drunk but fine otherwise.

Next morning Paula got a text from Pauric saying that he was having a few people over to help him collect stones in his lawn in preparation for a few grass seeds. So Paula went home and got changed and picked me up at four. We sat around for a while and played pirates with Ciara and Niamh and then started collecting the stones. It was a big lawn too! We stopped for some food and finally got finished at about half nine. The fact that it was another brilliant day helped though and there was great craic with everyone there. He did reward us with a few beers though which was well appreciated.

Tuesday and Wednesday were fairly quiet. I did go to meet Paula in the bookies on Tuesday evening but there wasn't much happening around there. I also went to see 'Star Trek' in the cinema. It was good but I'm not too sure about the alternative time-line idea. I guess with the sequels it might work out alright. Shelly was in the flat today too and she and Adam made a stir fry but that was the only excitement for today.
