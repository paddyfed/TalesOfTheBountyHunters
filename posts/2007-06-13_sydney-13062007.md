So the eagle has landed. We arrived in Sydney about two hours ago, it's now 8 in the morning! It's very cold here though, about 7 degrees. We're staying in a hostel for tonight then Sweets knows these ones who have been here a while so we'll stay with them for a while before heading up to Cairns eventually.

> So the hostel was Wake-Up! hostel on Pitt St. It was a bit of a chore to get there as we hadn't realised that taxi drivers only know streets (if even that) and they don't know where things are. Another case in point was when we tried to get to the Tea Gardens in Bondi Junction for the first time.

Gonna see about getting some sleep and maybe unlock my phone to send a few text msgs to y'all.

> Never did unblock my phone after all that. For some reason the code to unblock it wouldn't work. Just wanted to put in here a bit about our last night in Bangkok. After we left Duff and Ali we headed out drinking again and headed to the same night club that we'd been in with Steve. There we got hammered drunk and played the best frame of pool ever! Next day I had a massive hangover and God only knows how I managed to get on the plane after how sick I was. Credit to the lads for not abandoning me.


G'day,
Paddy.
