So we survived another weekend of Sydney drinking. Friday night we were in the 'Cock and Bull' again for a few quiet ones. And true to form it turned into a session. We then went to the Tea Gardens until it closed but the night is a bit hazy. I know I definitely spent the night in the girls lovely (read sarcasm) hostel. 
> Try to imagine a small room with about three bunk beds crammed into it, not much room for anything else and about ten girls living in the one space. That's basically what the hostel, or hovel, they were living in for the first few weeks was like.

Next day, after a long walk home, we went into town to buy a few more Christmas decorations. Yes we have our tree up and it looks lovely, especially with Pete the penis fairy on top. That night it was back to 'PJ O'Briens' where we watched the Italia 90 recap from 'Reeling in the Years'. Oh and the girls kept dropping like flies! Get some proper shoes! Oh and I won't go into the whole 'Ghost' thing, far too embarrassing! We ended the night in the 'Three Monkeys', which was poor to say the least, and a kebab before getting the taxi home. 
> Yea the Three Monkeys is crap. I'd avoid it at all costs. This was also the night that I got the call from my old landlord from Monaghan looking to give me a reference. Of course by this time we'd already moved into the flat so it was a bit late.

So Sunday came around and the tradition of going to the 'Tea Gardens' for dinner didn't last long. We instead went to the 'Rose Shamrock and Thistle' hotel (covering all their bases there, eh?) for dinner. We then went to 'Durty Nellys' for pints. Not only was that another Irish pub to tick off the list but they definitely have the best pint of Guinness in Sydney and possibly Australia. 
> I don't think I had a better pint anywhere else. That Sunday was a great day too because it made all of us feel like we were in a pub back home. Durty Nelly's is probably the most Irish pub outside Ireland that I've ever been in. Too bad I wasn't able to do the 100 Guinness pints thing that they have going on.

Then it was back to the 'Cock and Bull' for a final few pints before home. The lads started their new jobs today as road builders or some crap like that. So hopefully we're all getting settled in for the long haul. Oh and I hope Yvonne will have the dinner made for us when we get home :) 
> Yvonne, Becky and Maria were staying with us for a few weeks while they found some better accommodation and it was great to have our dinner made for us a few times. I even started eating corn on the cob!


Steak for me please,
