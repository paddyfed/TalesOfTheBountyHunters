Thursday was an okay day at work and I went out to football as usual although I didn't win this time I did manage to score and we only lost by a few. That was the good part of the day though as I found out when I got home that Paula's uncle Jim wasn't well. It just seems to be another blow to the family and hopefully they'll get through it. I did talk to Paula on the phone that evening and she seemed good, just a bit worried about her dad.

On Friday I was working in the evening and Paula came over after work and we had a Chinese for dinner. Adam was playing Pro Evo on the XBOX so we watched that for a while and we put our Christmas lights up. She was really tired after working and college so she stayed the night. I then went to put a ticket in her car and was stopped by two different sets of plain clothed Garda&iacute; in the car park. I guess I looked a bit suspicious.

Paula was working in the morning and I got to stay in bed. The [Ireland and South Africa match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2009/1128/ireland_southafrica1.html) was on so I watched it in the flat. I then fixed the lights and got some beer for the party. Emer left us in GAME a few weeks ago so we were having a goodbye party in the flat for her. We basically sat in the flat and played Rock Band for hours. I've a great video of Neil singing 'Living on a Prayer' that I have to upload! Everyone went back home around two in the morning.

So today I didn't get up too early but thankfully I didn't really have too bad of a hangover. I went down to the bookies and Paula and I left Emma home from work. Paula then stayed for dinner which is the first time she's had dinner in our house. She went home not long after that and I got back to the flat after the pancakes. Mum and Dad decided to pay for our 'Star Wars in Concert' tickets as a Christmas present so now I don't have to worry about paying for them. Though my new He-Man figures will soon be paid for, well assuming my subscription is still valid!

Paddy.
