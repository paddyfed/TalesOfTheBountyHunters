Monday was back to football for the first time in weeks and my legs were killing me. We stopped in the Poc to see the [United and Newcastle match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0816/manutd_newcastle.html) too. On Tuesday and Wednesday I was in Paulas for dinner and we went out home to give Becky her sponsorship money for the bike ride. Also [Mo-Larr](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.201936600) and [Orko](http://www.mattycollector.com/store/matty/en_US/DisplayProductDetailsPage/productID.201936800) had arrived!

I was working on Thursday evening so I couldn't play football. Paula came over to the flat on Friday evening and we had turkey supreme for dinner. We then went out to her house as we were helping to look after the kids while Caroline was away. We got Happy Feet for them to watch but it was damaged and skipped a lot. Also James was just not in the mood for sleep!

Eventually they were all in bed and PJ and Anne Curley were over for a drink and Martin and Dympna were over for a while too. On Saturday everyone else was away or at a funeral so Paula and I were looking after the kids. We made rice krispie buns and had a disco in the front room. When Caroline got back we headed to Martinas to help with the preparations for the party on Sunday. After that we went back to town and made some food and watched Kick Ass on DVD.

On Sunday we headed over to Martinas early to help out some more. Everyone else started arriving around two and then we had our food. After a few speeches and cutting the cake we headed inside and watched a bit of their wedding video. Unfortunately three month old Paula wasn't on it though. We went back to Paulas after that and went straight to bed.

Paula left me back to the flat this morning and I've spent most of the day fixing Patricias laptop which had a virus on it and it's preventing any websites from coming up. We had football this evening too and Michelle had dinner ready for us when we got back which was really nice.
