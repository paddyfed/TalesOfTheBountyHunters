Didn't do a thing this weekend but we did get broadband in the flat on Wednesday so I'll be on [Bebo](http://paddy1138.bebo.com) a bit more often. We also have been on XBOX Live a few times and it's quite good. I'd like to find my copy of Halo 2 though so I can try it online. Lost Planet just seems like a poor replacement even if it is a cool game. I must try out Gears of War though. It's supposed to be good.
