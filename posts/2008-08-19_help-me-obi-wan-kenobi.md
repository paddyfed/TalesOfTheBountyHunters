Well it was an action packed week to catch up on. It all started last Wednesday when I went out with Johnny and Adam to watch the football in the Pig. We stayed there for the second half of the Liverpool match and then went over to the Camel. Yes, I know we're a bit old for the Camel. But we made up for it by going to the Forum after it, oh wait, that's not right. Very drunken night. We had this free drink, Sol, in the Camel which was terrible. Avoid at all costs!

Thursday was invited to play football with the lads out in Ballinode. It's the first time I'd played since coming back and the first time in about six months. So as you can imagine I was dying afterwards!

On Friday I headed down to Dublin with Jade to go and see the new Star Wars Clone Wars animated movie. So we walked around town for a while, bought a few Star Wars and Halo books and got my replacement camera. In the evening we went to the UGC on Parnell St to watch the movie with Odie. It was good, it just didn't have the same impact as a proper movie. Also there was a lot to take in.

So on Saturday we stayed in the flat because it was pouring rain all day. We did get to watch a few episodes of Frasier which was good. We then got the bus back to Monaghan and luckily missed the traffic from the Tyrone - Dublin match. When we got back to Monaghan we got Jade's car, which was nearly in this huge flood in the car park. Thankfully we were able to get out and get a few beers. We were going out to her house with Adam and Michelle to play Rock Band, which we did for most of the evening. We also played Scene It! and I don't think Sean was too happy that I kept winning. Stayed in the house that night as it was about three in the morning when we finished up.

Sunday we lazed about the house watching the football. Villa beat Man City 4 - 2 and Man United drew with Newcastle 1 - 1. At least Becks won her bet. That evening I met up with Johnny, Elaine and Pamela in the pig for a few drinks. Nothing mad though, thankfully! Sat up talking to Emma when I got home and we've decided to start learning to drive, well sometime soon anyway.

So that brings us to Monday and not much happened. Played football in Gortakeegan for the first time again and I wasn't as bad as the first time. Still dying afterwards but at least I managed to play for the full hour.

So tomorrow I'll be heading down to Dublin again to see The Killers in Marlay Park on Thursday. Carlile is seeing Metallica on Wednesday night so might meet up with him then and Stan is heading to The Killers so will hopefully meet up with him then too.

Paddy.
