There was no football on Thursday so I headed out to Paulas instead and we went for a walk. On Friday I was working until four and then headed back to the flat to make dinner. We were heading off to Sligo this evening and we wanted to get away early. When we got checked in we got ready and had a few drinks in the bar of the hotel, we were staying at the Sligo Park hotel by the way.

We were up early for breakfast the next day and we went for a swim in the pool. We then walked around town for a few hours, had a hot chocolate and headed back. We had our dinner at seven, the woman serving us was having a bit of a nightmare day, and then we got ready to head out again. We headed to McHughs, Garavogue for one and Velvet Rooms. We headed home before the rush at about two in the morning.

Sunday we didn't get up too early but we were out of the room by 12. We got something to eat in Garavogue and we headed down the road to Stephens party, getting him a few toy cars along the way. After a few bounces on the bouncy castle (James apparently said my name too) and some cake, we headed back to my house. I told Mum and Dad that I'd probably be moving back home soon. Just to kick things off I stayed the night too.

I headed to town early on Monday and went back to bed for a while. I then went and bought food for dinner as well as picking up Paulas dress. Paula then came over after work and we got some food for Tuesdays dinner. There was football in the evening too and my team actually won for once!

I was working on Tuesday morning and Paula picked me up after work and we went out to her house and made a different, and quite hot, curry for everybody. We also went out for a walk that evening. She left me back to town on Wednesday morning and I sat playing "God of War II" until I had to go to work. I also headed out to Paulas house for dinner.

So today is Dads Birthday and Paula left me back to the flat this morning and I've been playing "God of War II" for a while. Though I'm at this really annoying part! I'm working at five this evening so there'll be no football and the weekend is looking busy. Paula is heading to a wedding in Donegal. Friday we might be having dinner for dad in the house and Saturday is Gavins Birthday, a staff get-together and the Blues festival is back!

Paddy.
