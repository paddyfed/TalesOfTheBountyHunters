I was working the late on Thursday so I couldn't go and play football. Instead Paula came over for a while and we had dinner in the flat. I was working late on Friday too and Paula was out at a retirement do for one of her bank friends. So I met up with them in Terrys for a few drinks and Ciara, Paula and I went to Deerys for the night. Paula also stayed in the flat too.

Saturday morning Adam was moving a few things out but we didn't surface too early. Instead we packed a few things and took them back out home. We were babysitting in Carolines that evening so we got a DVD, 'Extract', which was quite good. The girls were really good too. We watched 'Total Wipeout' and 'X-Factor' before they went to bed. James eventually fell asleep in the buggy but he woke up again when we tried to put him in the cot! So back to the buggy he went.

I was up around eleven on Sunday and sat around the house for most of it. We watched a bit of the [All-Ireland Football final](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0919/cork_down1.html) but we went to town to get a few things in the middle of it. [United also beat Liverpool today](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0919/manutd_liverpool.html). We didn't do much in the evening, just watched a bit of TV, oh and we did move some cattle but it wasn't that traumatic.

Monday was back to work day. I was in for the morning and it was quiet. Played football in the evening too and it was actually a good match that ended in a draw. It was definitely one of the better matches we've played in a long while.

I was working on Tuesday evening and Paula came into the shop to pick up the keys so that she could have a shower. We headed to her house when I finished work and had steak for dinner. We also headed to Ted and Eileens house that evening and sat talking to James B and Louise. Paula was a bit upset when we got home as Ted was looking very failed even though he was in good form. I don't think she got a lot of sleep that night.

So today Paula left me back to the flat and I wasn't in the best of moods at work. I think I was very tired too. I did buy Scene It for the Xbox and Paula came over for dinner. Tonight is the last night of her cookery class but she might go to a different one on Thursday nights instead.

Paddy.
