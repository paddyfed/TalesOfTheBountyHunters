This week we have been mostly doing nothing special. We did have our first barbecue in a few weeks and we finally worked out how much food to get. Usually we make too much and it's thrown out but this time we got it just about right. We had a few beers after that and it was supposed to be a 'quiet' night in. Cairns city centre was not on the agenda. However after a few Southern Comfort and cokes the lads were convincing themselves that it'd be a good idea. I decided to stay at home to save some money and to not be dying on Sunday morning as has been the case. So I had an interesting night in while the lads managed to meet William Wallace in PJ's.
> Bit sad that I missed this night out cause it sounded like a good one. Plus those unplanned nights sometimes end up being the best. So I sat in and called home, probably for the first time in a long time. I remember talking to Edel about Man United's terrible start to the season. How things turn around eh? I think I also remember telling people of my plan to move down to Sydney in the next few weeks even though I hadn't fully decided yet. I already knew that GAME were opening a store in Cairns but I don't remember if I had the interview yet. As it turned out they weren't opening until after we left. I did get a job offer though. Working in GAME Australia though? Good idea?

The next day it was sore heads all round and the planned Sunday dinner never materialized but no matter. That night I finally managed to see an Irish Rugby game as we lost to Argentina and were finally put out of the World Cup. I guess it's back to the drawing board for Eddie O'Sullivan.

Hopefully Australia will put England out this weekend,
Paddy.
