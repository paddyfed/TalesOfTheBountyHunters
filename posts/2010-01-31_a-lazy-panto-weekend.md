I was working on Friday but I was finished when Paula was back in town. So we went to the shops and got food and went back to the flat to make it. We decided on beef curry as it's something we can both eat. So we made that and it was fantastic and we then just lazed about the flat for the rest of the evening. I did get a call from Devaney who was down in Monaghan for the evening but neither of us were in the mood to move. Instead we watched the Inbetweeners.

We didn't get up too early on Saturday and we designed an invite for Sean's birthday. Thankfully it's going ahead because I think everyone needs a good celebration! We got a few samples printed and they look good. We then got Paulas wing mirror fixed and went out to her house for dinner. We didn't get a chance to stay long though as we had to go back into town for the panto in the Garage Theatre. Steph was playing 'Dick Whittington' and even Seamie was in it. It was really good and the French policeman was a firm favourite. We headed to the Pig for a few drinks after that and then headed back to Paulas.

So this morning I didn't get up too early and the girls were over too. So we sat around the house for a while but thankfully there wasn't too much messing being done. Paula headed to Dunnes to do some shopping although that wasn't that successful, and she left me out home for dinner. I tried to listen to the [Arsenal and United](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0131/arsenal_manunited.html) match but we could only get highlights on TalkSport. We had dinner and pancakes in the evening and Mum told us about Denis' party next Friday so I'll have to try to get that evening off. Oh and we also managed to book some time in the house in Donegal. We should hopefully be going at the end of March for a few days! Not only that but the Six Nations and Superbowl Sunday is next weekend too! Action packed!!
