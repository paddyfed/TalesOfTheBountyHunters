Yep Carlile was down this weekend as I thought. He text me on Saturday afternoon and we met up in the Pig and watched the [Munster and Leinster match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2009/0502/munster_leinster2.html). Mum and Dad also came in for the second half of the match and we went to the West after it for food. I went back to the flat for a while after that and Paula came out to meet me after she came back from Dancing on Ice in Belfast. We then went to McKennas for a bit more trad music and then back to the West for Mick McGoldrick & Band. I was working on Sunday so I couldn't drink too much. Emma and I did get our photo taken for the paper so we'll have to see if that makes it in. After the concert we headed back to Paulas house.

Sunday Paula left me in to work and she headed back home to study. Thankfully we were busy enough at work so it flew by. Carlile text me again and I met up with them in the West. Most of Paulas family were there too and we all went to watch Beoga who were fantastic. We sat drinking for most of the night and Paula took her ones home. Monday it was up early again as we were heading down to Dublin to see Ross Noble. We left the car in Noras and got the bus to the flat. After resting for a while we got a take away and headed down to the Olympia. We were in unreserved seats in the upper circle and we met Sara and Landers there. Thankfully we got good seats and the gig was fantastic. Ross was as random as ever and I especially liked his 'Wankers on Stilts' idea! We went for a few drinks after the gig but noting mad.

So today we headed back home. We stopped in home for a while, and some bacon sandwiches. Emma was working at one so we left her in and Paula headed home to study some more. So I've been sitting in the flat updating some of this blog and waiting for the Champions League to start. C'mon United!
