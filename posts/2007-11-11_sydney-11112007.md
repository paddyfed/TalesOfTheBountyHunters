Well what a week! Melbourne was brilliant to say the least even though we didn't get to do all the things we wanted. On Monday we planned to go on the Neighbours tour but the lads didn't arrive down in time. 
> I'd also planned to meet up with Clare and Jenny at the Neighbours trip but I don't think they ended up going either. This was one of the things we didn't get to do which was a shame. Other notable things was going out to Albert Park and getting a photo taken of the O'Hara Burke and Wills statue although Robert O'Hara Burke appears to be no relation.

I did get to see the Melbourne cup parade through the town though but I did forget my camera, shame on me. Never leave without your camera! So that night we just went for a few drinks in the bar. 
> This was the first time that I'd met some of the girls. From what I remember it was Paula, Maria, Brady, Lauren and Yvonne. At this stage though I didn't have a notion what their names were. They were just the Frasier girls.

Tuesday was Melbourne Cup day and we had to be up early to get all dolled up. We met up with the girls from Frasier Island while I met up with a few ones from Sydney. After the races (of which I had no winners) we went into town and met up in PJ O'Briens (as usual) for more drunken mess. 
> Yep so this was one of the great nights we had in PJ's in Melbourne. We had all met earlier in the day but I'd only met the girls briefly as I was away chatting to Clare and Jenny. It took me ages to find them  as I couldn't hear too well from my phone. Eventually we met up in the stand. Then we watched the Melbourne Cup race from near the finish line. After the race most of the people left so it was a lot easier to get around. This was the night of the infamous stolen hat. This was also the first time that we met Paul although Landers obviously knew him beforehand.

Wednesday we took a trip on the tram out to St Kilda, where the girls were staying. We didn't plan on staying the whole day but we (eventually) found a pub and we stayed there all night. 
> I can figure out where the pub was but I can't for the life of me remember what it's called. It was a good night though even though we stayed in the pub a lot longer than we intended.

Thursday it was back to the races, this time for ladies day. We managed to sell our tickets to two of the English girls, Kelly and Haley, so we all hung around together that day. Again no winners but I did have a couple of thirds. Kelly, however, backed the only Irish sounding horse on the last race and it won! The only time we didn't back the Irish horse! Anyway then it was back to PJ's where the Irish girls met up with us again. That night was even more of a drunken mess but it was all good! 
> The Irish girls being the Frasier girls of course. This was without doubt the best night out we had in Melbourne. We stayed in PJ's all night and we started off with the infamous drinking game! Later on when the other girls came in, along with Paul and Paddy, we continued to party and go mad for the rest of the night. I especially liked being carried around the lobby of the shopping centre that PJ's was in. Was a great day at the races too. As it was Ladies Day we did spend quite some time checking out the form, of the horses of course.

So Friday came around and after the hangover went away we decided to go to the cinema to watch 'Lions for Lambs'. Word of advice, if you want 90 minutes of talking pure politics then go see this movie, or watch Question Time. Either way you'll probably be bored. 
> The girls were heading up to Sydney by car the next day and we were flying so we didn't end up in the pub. I remember saying goodbye to them and thinking that we'd probably never meet up with them again. How wrong I was eh?

Saturday came and it was time for us to head back to Sydney. As I said before we didn't get to do all that we wanted but I think we'll probably come back sometime next year for another week, this time with less drinking! Killers tonight, excellent!

Wow this was a long post,
Paddy.
