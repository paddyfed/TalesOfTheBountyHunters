I was working on Tuesday but headed out to Paulas house for dinner. We were heading out for a few drinks that night so she got ready while at the same time [Chelsea were getting knocked out of the Champions League](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0316/chelsea_inter.html). We headed to the Poc for our drinks and met up with Ciara and a few of her friends. There was a live band and they were playing some great classic Irish songs which reminded me so much of the Mercantile in Sydney. I wish there was a pub that played that type of music all the time. Paula even had a few drinks herself and stayed over in the flat.

Thankfully I wasn't working early on Wednesday as the shop was on reduced hours because it was Paddy's Day. I was working at 2 and that's when Paula headed home. I was working early on Thursday morning so there wasn't any point in heading out for a few drinks so I headed back to the flat and watched the [Barcelona and Stuttgart match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0317/barcelona_stuttgart1.html).

On Thursday we had a visit from our new regional manager. Kevin was in too but I have to say I wasn't that impressed by our new manager. Maybe he'll be alright though I have my doubts. There was football again this evening and Ashley was back for the first time in a few weeks so I didn't have to worry about getting a lift. The match itself was close for a long time and although they had the best attacking players and probably the best defensive player we held on. Eventually Pauric, who was in goal all night due to an injured leg, lost his mojo and we rattled in a few goals. I scored two myself, one of which was a cracking strike into the right of the goal.

So today I wasn't working at all and I didn't get up too early either. I bought everybody dinner in Flemings and Paula took me out to her house. Stephanie was looking after the girls and James so we played around with them for a while. James was in my arms for most of the time and wouldn't go to Paula or Stephanie when I tried to hand him over, that was quite funny though. We had a few drinks in the evening and Paula left me back to the flat.

Tomorrow is the last day of the Six Nations and Ireland are on course for another Triple Crown, only Scotland stand in their way, and hopefully England can prevent France from getting the Grand Slam but I doubt it. A draw would be nice result or a win for England by at least 40 points. Oh and there's also the small matter of United playing Liverpool on Sunday. Even if the result doesn't go our way Battle Cat will cheer me up!

Paddy.
