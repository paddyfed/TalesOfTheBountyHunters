Saturday: I decided to make dinner at home as Paula was working and I wanted to make dinner for her. We had sweet Thai chilli stir fry. We watched TV at home and then got a DVD out ‘McGruber’ before Paula went home

Sunday: Headed to Stephanie's for dinner, the Girls and James were there too but they couldn't stay long as they had to go to a birthday party in town. We headed back to Paulas house and had a bit of a rest and a lie down. Eventually though we had to get up and head home as Paula had to be at work early in the morning.

Monday: Paula had a bord bia audit today and it went really well. I headed out to her house after work so that Gerard could give me a lift to football.

Tuesday: Was out in Paulas house and watched the [Ireland v Slovakia match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/1012/slovakia_ireland_report.html). It ended in a draw but really should have won it.

Wednesday: I wanted to head to town early to get my hair cut but no such luck. The car battery had run down and we couldn’t even open the doors. I was working at 1 and I managed to get in for that. I wanted to get my suit dry-cleaned too but that would have to wait. Paula made burgers for dinner that evening too.

Thursday: I had a technical test with Computershare and it went OK. Nobody knew about it but I did have to tell Mum as I needed a lift in. I will find out in about two weeks if there’s to be a second interview. I was then working from 1 to 9 so I couldn’t play football. Paula did make some spicy lemon-grass chicken for dinner.

Friday: Roboto was on sale today. I didn’t get up early enough to tidy my room much. I headed out to Paulas house and went for a walk. Her Mum and Dad headed down to Gorey that evening too so we had a nice relaxing evening.

Paddy.
