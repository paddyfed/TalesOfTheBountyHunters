This is a bit of a catch up so there won't be a lot of detail in this. On Wednesday we went out to Carolines to babysit as she was away in Cavan. We took Ciara to the pool but Niamh was very restless so it was quite stressful. Paula went out in Dundalk on Thursday night too but she didn't feel that well so it wasn't a great night. She stayed in Killaney while I sat in the flat and watched [Liverpool get knocked out of the Europa League](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0429/liverpool_atletico.html). So I now owe Paula a Little Neroni dinner sometime.

Paula was over in the flat before I had to go to work on Friday and [Gerry Ryan died](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0430/ryang.html) today too. Paula was working on Saturday but the Feil&eacute; Oriel festival was on so she came into town and we made curry for dinner. We then went and met Brian and Marie in the Poc and at the gig rig. We headed back to Paulas house after all that.

I sat on the couch listening to the [Chelsea and Liverpool match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0502/liverpool_chelsea.html) and it looks like the title race is actually over. We went back to town to the Feil&eacute; Oriel and met up with everyone in the Poc. We listened to the bands at the gig rig for a while and then went back to the Poc and then to the West to watch Beoga. We went for a Chinese at the end of the night and headed back to the flat.

I was actually working on the bank holiday Monday but I met Dad outside the shopping centre so I headed home for dinner. I went for a walk in town with Paula on Tuesday and we watched the [Spurs and Man City match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0505/mancity_spurs.html) on the computer on Wednesday which was a brilliant match!

Thursday was Paulas Birthday so I bought food and headed to her house to make a turkey stir-fry for dinner. We then went to Armagh cinema to see Iron Man 2. I was working on Saturday for a while and then I finished Elaines Communion photos for her. We then had enchiladas for dinner in Paulas house and Gerard, Sean, Paula and I met up with Ted, Eileen, Chris and Nora in Wrights for a few drinks.

We were at the blessing of the graves on Sunday and out to Ted and Eileens for tea afterwards. I headed back into town to see the [final games](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0509/manchesterunitedstoke.html) [of the season](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0509/chelsea_wigan.html) with Gavin in the Poc. There's always next year!

Paula had her first exam on Monday and it went well. I went to her house after dinner and got a lift to football with Gerard. I was going to make turkey curry for dinner today but there wasn't any turkey so Paula and I went for a walk and made beef stir-fry instead.

Paddy.
