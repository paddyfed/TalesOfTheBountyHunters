And we're halfway through another week and what a week it was. Friday was Peoplebanks Christmas party and it was in a place called Establishment. Very nice place, expensive but the meal wasn't much. It was all free though (yes even the drink). We started at about 1pm and there was this comedy (read not funny) bingo competition. Plus I actually won a raffle for a trip on a sailing boat in the harbour so that'll be fun. For my secret Santa present I got Guinness cans and a t-shirt so I was well chuffed about that. After the meal we went downstairs to the bar where we started drinking Jagerbombs, again all free, so I was suitably tanked when I arrived back at the flat. 
> Suitably tanked was a bit of an understatement. I had said in an earlier post that I would need to be a bit quieter at the Christmas Party as I had gotten very drunk at the contractor party. I think on the most part I succeeded as I wasn't that drunk leaving Establishment however all the drink caught up with me on the way back to the flat and I was a bit wobbly. Everyone else being sober probably didn't help either.

We all went out drinking in the 'Cock and Bull' and then the 'Tea Gardens' but I don't remember much about that. Also we managed to play drunken Twister when we got home. Nice and messy! The next day, after recovering, we went to Coogee to see the girls new house and for a few drinks. Their house is huge but there are a few strict rules (which will probably be broken in a few weeks by us). At least they're out of the hole they were in though. That night wasn't too bad because it was quite late when we went out and we didn't go into the city. 
> This actually was quite a good night. We stayed in the CBH all night and just sat around and had the craic. The rules in the girls flat mainly consisted of, no people staying over, be quiet on the stairs and no pissing over the balcony. Don't know how we did on those in fairness.

Sunday was supposed to be no beer day but we ended up going to the 'Tea Gardens' for dinner and that led to meeting up with Lauren for drinks in the 'Cock and Bull'. That was great craic and then the other girls joined us a few hours later. We didn't end up in the city with them though, work in the morning and all that. 
> I don't really remember this day and I've no photos so I'm not sure. I think it was me and Landers who went to the Tea Gardens and it was probably Paula and Maria that met up with us, but as I said I can't be sure. It obviously wasn't a mad night anyway.

Monday and Tuesday ended up as no beer days which was good to sober up. Tonight I'm going down to our old hostel to meet up with the ones I shared the dorm with who I haven't seen since before Melbourne. 
> I met up with Clare, Jesus, Baz, Kev, Tim and Jan in the Sidebar and it was good to see them all again. Clare and Jesus came along to the Tea Gardens and met up with a few of the lads. Was a good night but again no pictures!

No plans for the weekend though. It'll probably be the usual drinking and carrying on. I'll tell you all about it next week.
> A disguised nod to the fact that I'd be back in Ireland by next week. Did you see it coming?


See ya,
Paddy.
