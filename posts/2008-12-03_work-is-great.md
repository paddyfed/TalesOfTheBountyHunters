Yea I remember now why I hated working in GAME so much. Nine times out of ten it's grand but those days where it's just crazy busy and you don't have the stock to sell to people and you have to try to push things like extended warranty on people (although in the old days it was extra control pads). It just wears you down! It's the first time I'd felt like that though. Tuesday wasn't too bad either. even though it did take us an extra hour to get out of the shop due to a credit card machine mix-up. No matter though.

Friday we have a table quiz in Wrights in Glaslough in memory of Shelly's dad Brian. Mum and Dad are planning to head to it too so it should be good craic. Also it's the GAME Christmas party on Saturday and Sherry and Leona will be joining us so it'll be just like old times! Which reminds me, I must charge my camera battery.

Paddy.
