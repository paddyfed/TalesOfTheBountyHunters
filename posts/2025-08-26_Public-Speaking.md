Today was the FET meeting in the Cavan Crystal hotel. I had been asked to present the Academic Integrity online module that I have been developing over the last few weeks. It all went well, people seemed impressed by the module itself and praise as well for the presentation. The next few weeks we will tidy things up and have it ready for the start of September.

Registration for Monaghan Institute will be on the 1st September with induction taking place the week of the 8th. I'm pretty sure I will be going back as the timetable is only for 3 days a week and this should give me time to do other work. Whether that be with CMETB or with my own clients I'm not sure of yet.
