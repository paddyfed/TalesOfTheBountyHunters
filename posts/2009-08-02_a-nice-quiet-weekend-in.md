I actually didn't realise that it's been a week since I updated here, I was only on the other day posting some [old blog entries](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/Old%20Blog) that I found from an old site that I was using. It's probably not that interesting to anyone but me, but I wanted to have all my musings in one place so I'll be putting the rest up later.

Tuesday was quiet enough. I was at work for most of the day and then played football with Ben and his mates in the evening. Wednesday was a bit livelier. Although I was at work all day Ben and his cousin Dillon came over to the flat and we had a few beers with Adam all while playing Rock Band. So that was good craic and later we went to McKennas for last orders. We met up with Vikki who just passed her driving test and Sean who had a deck of cards to show us. Adam went home with Shelly and Ben and I went back to the flat for more beers. I think we eventually stopped at about five in the morning. I was grand but Ben had to go to work three hours later!

I wasn't working Thursday so I lazed around the house for a while. Paula came over and decided to stay the night as she had quite a bad day at work. We sat up and watched 'Flight of the Conchords' to cheer her up. Friday morning Paula headed back to work but I wasn't working until five. We decided to get some food after work and head out to her house to watch a DVD. It was a good plan until we had to wait ages in Tommies for chips. You would've thought that they would have loads on seeing as they are a chip shop! Oh and I was talking to Carlile, who also passed his test, and Marie. They were heading to Metallica on Saturday. We eventually got our DVD, it was 'Taken' with Liam Neeson in it and it was very good!

Saturday we spent the day lazing about Paulas house. We did go to Emyvale for a bit of shopping and went for a nosey around her Granny's house and Ted and Eileen's. We ordered a pizza in the evening and we picked up 'Zoolander' to watch that evening. On Sunday Paula was working at twelve so she left me back to the flat. I did go around and get a book for Elaine though and left it over to her. We did head to the flat as Paula was on a break but only for half an hour. I then sat up and watched the [Tyrone and Kildare match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2009/0802/tyrone_kildare_.html) before Dad picked Me and Emma up for dinner. Everything was quiet at home and Mum and Dad got me a wine bottle puzzle thing for my Birthday. My Man-At-Arms arrived too so the collection is getting big!

So I'm not working tomorrow as it's a bank holiday and thankfully we didn't head out as I really wasn't in the mood for it. We'll save up our money for next weekend!

Paddy.
