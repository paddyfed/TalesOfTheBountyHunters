So we've covered the Dundrum store for the past week and it's mostly gone well. On Tuesday I was on the late shift and we didn't get back to the hotel until near eleven again. I did give Paula a call but she really wasn't having a good time in college so it wasn't the best phone conversation we ever had.

I was in early on Wednesday and this time we were on time to open up. We watched a few episodes of 'South Park' and 'Big Bang Theory' when we got back to the hotel. I was in the late shift on Thursday and I also had to close up. Thankfully it all went well though. Again we were back in the hotel late but I did manage to call Paula for a while.

I was really fed up going to work on Friday but thankfully we weren't in for the closing. Adam was finished today too so he went back to Monaghan. There was a Halloween party on in the hotel when Ben and I got back so instead of eating there we went to Pizza Hut for our dinner. Bill Bailey was on the TV too so we watched that. It was the same [show that we went to see back in June](/posts/2009-06-25_a-whole-week-to-catch-up-on) although Channel 4 had obviously cut loads of bits out.

We had to be up really early on Saturday as some guys were coming to fix the air conditioning in the shop. We did get a bit of work done though. We eventually finished at quarter past four and headed back to town to get our bus. We did get soaked walking to Parnell Square though. We managed to get a McConnons bus back and Paula picked me up from the car park. We got our dinner and headed out to her house as everyone was heading out to the Sherrys for a few fireworks. The Quinns and a few of the cousins were heading to the fancy dress in the West and we met up with Adam and Shelly there. After that we headed back to the flat for a bit of Rock Band and then out to Paulas house.

So today we got up and Paula headed to work. I was back in the flat and watched the [Abu Dhabi grand prix](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/1101/vettels.html) which was the last race of the season. Paula came over after work and we watched a bit of TV before I got a lift out home for dinner. She's still not enjoying college and unfortunately she is letting things get on top of her. I just hope that I can help her in some way.

Paddy.
