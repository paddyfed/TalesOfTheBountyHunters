Paula stayed in the flat on Friday night and on Saturday we went and got a present for the wedding that we are going to next Saturday. Paula wasn't feeling too well though so we didn't stick around too long. I went to the Pig to watch the [United and Arsenal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0516/manutd_arsenal.html). United only needed a point to win the league and they managed a 0-0 draw so the celebrations could begin, even if it was a boring match. Ashe went around the pub with a few shots of Mickey Finns for everyone. Plus I was texting Paula in New Zealand as she was watching the match over there. She did say there wasn't much of an atmosphere though!

I went back to the flat after that and Landers and Sara came over for a quick visit. They were looking for photos of the Great Barrier Reef that I had so I gave them back their disks. That evening we went out to Pamelas for a while and watched the Eurovision (exciting as ever I know). We did head to Wrights for a few drinks though and Ger and Elaine were telling me about some embarrassing photos that they have of Paula. Can't wait to see those.

On Sunday we went Karting with the lads in Newry which was fantastic craic. I didn't end up in the final (although I dont know how seeing as I had faster times than some of the others!) but it was well worth gong to. We should be going to paint ball next. I headed home for dinner after that and basically played Professor Layton all evening. I've finally finished it too.

Monday was the usual work and football although I didn't really enjoy playing for some reason. And no it wasn't just because we lost, I guess I just wasn't bothered busting my ass off for nothing. I did manage to get the Mattel subscription for the last four MOTU figures of 2009 so I don't have to worry about trying to get them. On Tuesday Paula had her final exam and it went well again. She came over to the flat that evening and we watched 'Hot Shots: Part Deux'. I also gave Paula her Birthday present, even though it was a few weeks late. I just wanted her to have it when she could appreciate it after she finished her exams.

So today it was work and not much else. I did go down to the bookies to say hello to Paula and Ryan was texting. I think he's going to go to Oxegen this summer. I also had my first SubWay from Monaghan and it's a bit obvious that they are all new in there as they're not too sure on their feet. But I guess they'll get better as they go on.

Paddy.
