So after watching the first Transformers movie on Thursday night we headed to the cinema on Friday to see the sequel 'Revenge of the Fallen'. Although the action was good the story was a bit all over the place and could've done with a coherent main plot. I'm glad I did go to see it in the cinema though. We went for a few drinks in the Pig after that and we saw Stephanie there too as she was out with her workmates.

I was working at ten on Saturday morning but thankfully I was only in until two. Plus I was in the stock room for the day so I didn't have to deal with any customers. I then went to watch the [second Lions test](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/lions/2009/0627/lions_southafrica_secondtest.html) with Mum, Dad and Emma in the Seasons. A really disappointing result to lose with the last kick of the game but they did play well for the most part.

That night Brian and Marie were down so we went to McKennas for a few drinks. Mark and Sara were there too and Paula joined us later after she had been in Caroline's for dinner. We stayed in McKennas for most of the night, even playing the coin game for a while. We did end up in the Forum but we stayed in the middle floor so it wasn't that bad. We left Brian, Marie and Lorraine home and I went and stayed in Paulas house for the night.

Sunday we got up early and headed to town as Paula was working. I went to the flat and watched 'Arrested Development' for most of the afternoon. I then went home for dinner and Joe and Eileen were there too. I called Paula when I got back to the flat but she was a bit too tired to talk. She really needs to get some rest! So today I was working and played Football in Gortakeegan. There was also a friendly match on between the Republic of Ireland Deaf Team and Monaghan United. Apparently it's part of some festival of football organised by the FAI. I was also in the bookies for a while to say hello to Paula and we're trying to organise how to get down to the port on Friday.

Also I just have to say how mad is it that Michael Jackson is dead. Sometimes I still can't believe it and it'll take a good few weeks before all the speculation and stories stop. You would've thought that people could leave him alone for once.

Paddy.
