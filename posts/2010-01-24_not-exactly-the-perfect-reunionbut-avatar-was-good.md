I was working again on Wednesday morning and I headed over to Paulas in the evening. We went for a walk around the circuit and we headed to Sainsburys in Armagh so that we could find some wheat free food for Paula. It was a bit disappointing though and Sainsburys seemed no better than Tescos really. We then went back to the house and we had a stir fry for dinner and Paulas uncle Seamus came over for a while.

Paula left me in to work on Thursday morning and the day was uneventful except for managing to break my phone! Paula came over to the flat in the afternoon but she didn't stay long as I had football in the evening. I even managed to win!

So Friday rolled around and I was working again! I did manage to swap shifts with Nicola though and Landers picked me up around three for the trip down to Dublin. We were having a bit of an Australia reunion and Sweets was heading back there for a while so it was a goodbye to him. We got to the hotel and went for something to eat and then started drinking in the hotel. Paula was also down in Dublin as she was heading out with Ciara and Martina. We started off in Solus on Camden St and had a few drinks there. We met up with Kat, Ellen and Katie and of course Paula W. and Maria were there from the start.

After that we headed to Fitzsimons but it was there that I found out that Paula and Ciara were having a few difficulties. I of course was then worried that she would be out in Dublin all on her own so I tried to call her but I couldn't get in touch. Now I was worried and a bit annoyed so I knew I couldn't enjoy the rest of the night. I decided to head back to the hotel and went to bed. I still couldn't get in touch though but thankfully she was fine. The rest of the guys continued drinking and eventually got about three hours sleep.

Next day we had to get up early and headed off. Landers and Sweets headed back to Monaghan and I hung about and went walking with Paula W. around Dublin. We eventually met up with Kat and Ellen for lunch and after tat I headed to the flat. Edel was finished work so we decided to go and see Avatar 3D in the cinema and I was very impressed. We were in the same screen that we [saw 'Revenge of the Sith' nearly five years before](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2005/06/20062005.html) too so that was nice. Paula was with her ones at the 'We Will Rock You' musical in the O2 and I was heading home with them after it. We met Paula on O'Connell St and got a taxi back to Noras. It was about two in the morning by the time we got back to the flat so we just crashed for the night.

So today we didn't get up too early but Paula headed home for her dinner. I just lazed in bed all day and watched the [Stoke and Arsenal match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0124/stoke_arsenal.html) and then went home for dinner. Mum and Dad were in Belfast so Becky made chilli for dinner. I was feeling a bit fed up earlier too but I chatted to Paula on the phone and she cheered me up. She's really good at doing that and I only wish I could do the same sometimes.

Paddy.
