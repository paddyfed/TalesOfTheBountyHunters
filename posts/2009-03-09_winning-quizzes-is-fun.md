It wasn't a mad week this week but we did do a few things out of the norm. On Wednesday I went to the hospital to have my X-Ray and thankfully that didn't take too long. The doctor told me that I hadn't broken anything and that it was just a bit sprained. I couldn't play football for a while, even though I hadn't played since it happened, and I was to wear an ankle support for a while. I was just relieved that I wouldn't have to have an operation!

Thursday we went to the Shamrock for the table quiz that had been cancelled two weeks running! It was Me, Adam, Paula and Ciara on one team and Pamela, Ger, Pauric and Ashley on the other. Not only did we beat them but we beat them well! That was a real turn up for the books! We didn't win the whole quiz but it was a moral victory in the end. Paula had been in the shop earlier in the day and she thought she would have to get more injections but thankfully she didn't.

On Friday night we all went out to dinner in Deerys to celebrate Shelly getting her award and the handing over of the cheque for the table quiz that they did back in December. It was a good night and the food was fantastic! We headed to the Pig for a few drinks after that. I didn't do much on Saturday as Paula was out at her uncle's 60th party. I stayed in and watched 'The IT Crowd' and 'Fifth Element'.

On Sunday though we went over to Caroline and Kevins to wee Ciara's Birthday party. We stayed for dinner and cake and we ran around the house for a while. We then watched terrible TV before heading back to the flat. So all in all not a bad week.
