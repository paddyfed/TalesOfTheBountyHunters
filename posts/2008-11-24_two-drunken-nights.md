Yes Landers is back in the country. Well he was actually back last Friday but he was staying in Dublin last weekend so we didn't get to see him. Anyway McHugh was organising a bit of a party in her house in Drogheda so Sweets and I were heading down for the night. We booked into a hostel in town and met up with McHugh at McDonalds, not before randomly meeting Maria in her car. That worked out well because she was kind of lost. So we got a bit of beer and went out to the house. Kat and Brady came in soon after that and we sat chatting to McHughs flatmates and their friends.

Later on Landers and Sara landed in and we stood in the kitchen chatting and catching up. We sat in the house until about midnight when we went to Fusion nightclub. It was a bit of a messy night especially with the straight Southern Comfort! After the nightclub we headed home in the taxi. I decided, for some reason, to go back to the house and to not bother staying in the hostel that I paid for. We nearly got roped into playing party games too but we just decided to find a bed and kip there for the night. Next day we got breakfast, said our goodbyes and headed home. There's talk of meeting up again in December, just before New Years Eve but we'll have to see what the craic is.

I got back home just in time to see the [Ireland vs Argentina match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2008/1122/ireland_argentina.html) although it wouldn't have been that disappointing to miss it as it was a terrible match. Anyway we were heading out that night too as Brian and Bird were down from Letterkenny for the weekend. We met up in McKennas and Paula, Pamela and Stephanie joined us. We sat there for a while having the craic, and watching Ben get really drunk. We headed then to the Forum, Paula, Pam and Steph headed home though, and we stood beside the bar on the bottom floor for the night.

Sunday, after recovering from a bit of a hangover, I headed over to Paulas house for our usual Sunday night DVD. This week it was the classic 'The Naked Gun'. In other news, work is getting better as I've been getting to know a few more things. It does come back to you quite quickly and I got a new till number so I'm not as much of a burden on everyone else. Oh and today I got The Killers new album 'Day and Age' and I've listened to it a few times. It's good but I'll have to see if it'll have the same longevity that their other albums had.

Paddy.
