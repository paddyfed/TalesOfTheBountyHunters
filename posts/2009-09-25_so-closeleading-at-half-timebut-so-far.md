On Wednesday I was in work all day but thankfully it didn't drag too much. I brought my football gear with me as we were playing that night instead of on Thursday. I wasn't sure I would get out on time but thankfully I did. Football was quite good too even though we did lose by a good few in the end. I was working again on Thursday until six but again it didn't drag.

I headed home for lunch at about two and saw Adam off as he was heading to do a fancy store opening in London. He was a bit nervous about it but he should be fine. It was Arthur Guinness day and we headed out to the Hillgrove to take part in a table quiz. It's the biggest one I'd been at in a long time, nearly 90 tables. It was Me, Paula, Ger and Johnny on one team and Ash, Shelly, Pamela and Barry on the other. We were joint first by half time but let it slip down to fourth by the end. And even though our two tables ended up on the same points we didn't actually cheat...Well not too much anyway.

I got a lift back to the flat after that and had a nice lie-in this morning. I headed down town and said hello to the guys in work. I was going to buy the new Professor Layton game that was out today but our electricity bill came so I decided to wait for a few weeks. I'm just determined not to have any of the puzzles spoiled for me on this game. I'm also trying to pack for Devaney's wedding tomorrow but it's not going too well so far. I'll be heading out to Paula's house tonight so that we can head on early in the morning. It should be great craic!

Paddy.
