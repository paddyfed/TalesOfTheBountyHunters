So the [match between Chelsea and Barcelona](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0506/chelsea_barcelona.html) has just finished and what a match that was. You could say that Barca snatched it in the end because Chelsea had all the chances even if Barca had the majority of possession. The scenes at the end were a bit disappointing but what do you expect from Drogba! I did want Barca to win though as I would prefer to play the better teams in Europe. At least then, win or lose, you can generally say that the best team won.

Last night too was a great [match between Arsenal and United](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0505/arsenal_manunited.html) although it was a bit disappointing that it was effectively over after about ten minutes. Some great goals though and it's another Champions League Final appearance for United! I just hope that we play as well as we did when we meet Arsenal in the league in a few weeks.

It was Paulas Birthday today too. I got her a card and sent off for a voucher for the Radisson in Cavan. I know it's not that original but I know that she really likes the Spa there so maybe she can treat herself after she finishes her exams. It was a bit disappointing that I didn't get to see her but she did get a visit from Caroline, James and the girls so I think that cheered her up.

Paddy.
