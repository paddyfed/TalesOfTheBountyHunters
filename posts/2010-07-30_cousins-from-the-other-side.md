I was back to work on Thursday morning and I really didn't want to be there. Thankfully I was only in until two so it went quickly. I also came back to the flat and did a bit more work on the site and, as I said, I was making a bit more progress. Dad also called me and we had a cousin from New Zealand coming to visit so I was heading out home to meet them. Una was a sister of Anne who [I met in Cairns](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2007/09/cairns-10092007.html) and she was travelling around Ireland with her husband John.

They were both really nice and we all had a great chat. Paula also came over to meet them and the time really flew by. We all had a few drinks and told a lot of stories about the house and about family. Paula then left me back to the flat and went home. She still wasn't feeling well and she was really worried by this stage.

So today I got word that Paula was feeling a lot better and I was really lazy and didn't get out of bed until nearly two. I've also done nothing with the site and now I'm heading out to Paulas to make a stir fry and possibly go for another walk. I'm at work all day tomorrow though so that will be fun!

Paddy.
