![Me again](/images/me_2.jpg "I just had to put this photo up")

Its just a quick update to say what a fantastic weekend in Kilkenny we had. I'll do a proper update hopefully tomorrow (or is it today?) with a few photos as I'm actually in bed typing this on my phone. I slept on the chair earlier and now I'm trying to get to sleep and I thought this might help. This and listening to The Dark Side of the Moon. So yea, expect more soon.

Update: This photo was taken on the night in question and I just had to put it up as my profile picture.

Paddy.
