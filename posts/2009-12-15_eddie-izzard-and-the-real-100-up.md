On Saturday I got the bus down to Belfast for the Eddie Izzard gig! Paula had an exam at twelve and thankfully she was happy with it. She headed out with the girls from the bookies that night and I think also met up with Ciara. Meanwhile Gavin picked me and Edel up from the bus and train and we headed out to their house and had chilli for dinner. Their friend Greg was over too and we all headed in a taxi to the Odyssey where the gig was on. Gavin decided to put up a [Twitter message](http://twitter.com/Gav_McGuinness/status/6607856824) but the system went down before we could see it.

The show was really great, it was just too bad that Landers couldn't make it because of his interview on Monday. After the gig we went into town to the Spaniard bar and had a few drinks. We were a bit hungry after that so we wanted to go for a Chinese and we heard of this place where you could actually sit down in. It was a bit surreal sitting in a Chinese restaurant at nearly three in the morning. As you can imagine we headed home after that.

We didn't get up too early the next day but we did have a fry before we headed off. Gavin gave me his old He-Man figures which was cool. It was a really foggy and cold night and I was going to go to Paula's for a while but I decided against it. She has started to get a bit of a flu too. I was back to work on Monday and Paula had her second exam. Again she was happy so it's two down and two to go. She came over to the flat and I headed out to football. We had spaghetti when I came back and we just relaxed in the flat. She was still feeling miserable from the flu.

This morning then Paula was up early as she headed out to Pauric's to do some study. She still isn't well though and it hasn't been going well. I have basically lazed about all evening although Landers was over in the flat for a while. He didn't get the job he interviewed for but he was closer than he thought. I went shopping for Pauric and Ger's presents and my Secret Santa present for work. I also managed to order Adam's Ghostbusters figure for him despite all the "[Could not increment allocated quantity for LineItem xxxxxxxxxx](http://www.actionfigureblues.com/2009/12/tale-of-woe-skeletor-lessness-and-motuc.html)" problems.

I've yet to find out if my own subscription has worked but hopefully it has and I hope that these problems will finally be ironed out by the time Battle Cat is on sale as that's the only one I really need to worry about. Anyway I was wrong in a [previous post](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2008/11/big-100.html). This is actually the 100th post of this blog ([TotBH](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/TotBH)) taking away the [Old Blog](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/Old%20Blog) posts and the [Australia](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/search/label/Australia) posts which I really need to get a move on with!
