Brilliant concert this weekend as Powderfinger and Silverchair rocked Cairns on their 'Across the Great Divide' tour of Australia.
> The tour was to benefit and bring awareness to the fact that there is a huge difference between the life expectancy of European Australians and Aboriginal Australians, hence 'The Great Divide'. They want to bridge that gap I suppose.

Although we only knew a few songs from each band they both put on a fantastic show, Silverchair especially. We couldn't really decide on or categorize what type of music they each play, especially as Silverchair went from heavy rock to more mellow stuff. I'd recommend watching the few videos on my flashbox or on YouTube to see what they're like.
> Silverchair have become one of my favourite bands after seeing them at this concert. It probably helps that their music just reminds me of some great times in Australia.

After the concert we walked into town to finish off the night. Without a doubt one of the best nights out since this whole adventure started.
> From what I remember we did our usual into PJ's and then the Woolshed. We were on such a high after the concert though so that's probably made it such a good night out in Cairns, if not my favourite night out in Cairns.

Didn't do much else apart from that. Just planning our next moves from here. Oh and watching England somehow win matches in the World Cup. I dunno, maybe if I start supporting them then they'll lose.

Couldn't do it anyway,
Paddy.
