To the world of The Mighty Boosh....

Not only was the show the best thing that I've seen in absolutely ages but it capped off a great weekend to boot. Friday night we went to Killanny to Paula's aunt's house for our dinner. We also went to the Monaghan vs Louth match in Inniskeen. It was a freezing night and the match was good, even if both teams were probably still feeling the Christmas and New Years celebrations. It was the opening of Inniskeen's new stand and floodlights so we sat in the stand and tried to keep warm. The match ended in a draw. After that we went to Tumulteys pub for a few drinks and a few games of pool. It's a nice pub actually, much better than we were led to believe. We all went home after that and I stayed in Paula's house.

Next day I got up and basically lazed around Paula's house. We did watch a bit of the darts and a bit of the [Liverpool FA cup match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0103/preston_liverpool.html). It wasn't great but it was funny when Gerrard was getting booed all the time. I eventually had to go home at about ten that night. It was a great lazy day.

Sunday we all headed to Deerys for food. It was Me, Paula, Adam and Shelly, Adam and Stephanie, Patricia, Pamela, Elaine, Caroline and Kevin and the Girls, and Paula's mum and dad. We had a few drinks before heading upstairs for our food which was great. The Girls again took a shine to me and we spent the end of the night folding napkins into different shapes. After the meal a few of us went to the West to annoy Johnny, oh and for a few drinks. We headed home after that.

Monday morning I got up early and got the bus down to Dublin. Becky had already driven down with Edel and Emma on Sunday evening so I missed that lift down. I didn't mind though as I walked around town for a while. It was a bit cold though so I didn't really stay long. So I hung around the flat for a few hours and when Edel and Becky came home we all had pizza. Then we headed off to the O2 for The Mighty Boosh! Brilliant show, I especially liked the Moon, Tony Harrison and the Crimp songs at the end, bouncy, bouncy, ooh such a good time. After the gig/show we walked back to the flat which took a bit of time and it was freezing too.

Tuesday I had another lazy day, i.e. I didn't get up too early. Emma and I did go down town for a bit of shopping though before we got the bus back home, I managed to get some new headphones but that was all. Dad was taking the Christmas decorations down when we got home so I guess that's it officially over for another year. It was a good one though. Also I've ordered a replacement power supply for my computer so hopefully it'll arrive soon and I can get a few photos up!!!
