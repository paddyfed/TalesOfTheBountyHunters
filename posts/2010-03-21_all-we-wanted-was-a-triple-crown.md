Well that was a disappointing result to say the least. [Ireland completely fell apart against Scotland](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0320/ireland_scotland1.html) and allowed them to play and eventually beat us by 20 points to 23. Although we had our chances to kill off the game it was by far the worst display by an Irish rugby team since the first half against Wales in the Grand Slam decider last year. France, as expected, went on to beat England and [complete their own Grand Slam](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2010/0320/france_england.html).

I was out at Adams for the match and it just wasn't the best atmosphere we've ever had. Adam for some reason was in a bad mood and stormed out with about twenty minutes to go in the match. We sat and watched the England match in relative silence and eventually Paula, who had been in Carolines looking after the children, came and picked me up. We headed to town and Paula decided to stay in the flat which was nice as I wouldn't have got to see her otherwise. She's back working in Paddys shop in Glaslough every other weekend so I think the money will come in handy for her.

So Paula had to get up early  for work (been a while since that's happened) while I've just lazed around the flat. I was listening to the [United and Liverpool match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0321/manunited_liverpool.html) on the radio and at least that result went our way. Heading home for dinner too soon and will no doubt get all our instructions for next weekend. Oh and I finally get Battle Cat in my hands! I wonder should I take my He-Man home with me?

Paddy.
