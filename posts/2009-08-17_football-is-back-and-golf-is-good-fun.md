On Thursday I was working in the morning and I decided to text Carlile to see if they would be about at the end of August for a visit. he thinks they will so that was grand but he also invited me to Devaney's stag party in Liverpool next week. So I had to re-organise the roster in work and make sure I could afford it but I'll be heading off to Liverpool for a long weekend! It was a great surprise and it should be great craic. I was at football that evening too and it ended in a draw which was a big surprise!

I was working again on Friday and Paula was working late too. So I had a Chinese and we went to the cinema to watch 'The Proposal'. Although it was a bit more of a rom-com than the usual films that we go to it still was fairly entertaining. A lot funnier than I thought it would be anyway. We went to the Pig for a few drinks after it and Paula took Ger home from Terrys after that.

Saturday was an action packed day! Paula was working so she couldn't come along but Me, Adam, Shelly and Sean went bowling in Blaney. Sean won the first round but I did manage to win the second. Only one strike though! After that Sean went to his friends house and the rest of us went to play Pitch and Putt. I think we can safely say that Adam won that one! We went out for dinner that evening in Deerys and it was the first time Pamela had been out since Zach was born. Owen was there too and it was the first time I'd met him. Paula and I went down to the Pig to meet Ciara for a drink but we didn't stay long. Paula eventually took all her ones home at about one.

Sunday I went out home early and listened to the United match on five live. Everything was quiet at home but there were a few new kittens out the back. We ended up listening to the golf that evening and watched Usain Bolt break the world record in the 100m final in the World Championships. I was back to work today and I managed to sort out the tickets to Liverpool. I'll be getting the bus up on Thursday and flying from Derry at about seven. I was also down in the bookies getting the hoover out for Paula and Una, apparently there was a spider on it earlier in the day!
