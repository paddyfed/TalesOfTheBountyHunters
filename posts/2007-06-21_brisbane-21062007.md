![Walking through China Town in Brisbane](/images/S6001091.JPG "Walking through China Town in Brisbane")

We arrived in Brisbane yesterday and we are staying in a hostel in the middle of the city.

> The hostel was called Bunk and it was quite a nice place. It was also the night that the schools were finished up so the bar in the hostel was quite full (think night after the leaving has finished). It was a good night though.

Things are going ok and we've organised what we're going to be doing on the trip up to Cairns. We are hiring a car and heading up the coast stopping off in towns along the way. Then on Airlie beach we are going on this boat trip out to the reef which should be cool. We went out for a few drinks last night but it wasn't a mad night. Tonight will probably be even quieter cause we have to check out before 10 and that's when we'll start the long trip.

> Our room was just above the bar though so we were kept up for a bit with all the people downstairs. Not much else happened in Brisbane. We did see a few of the sights in the city and again went to an Irish bar. Had my first Guinness for a long time here and it wasn't too bad as I remember.

Hopefully we'll still be near some computers so that I can keep you updated.

Cya,
Paddy.
