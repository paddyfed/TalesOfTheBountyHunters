Yes that's right it's the last full day with the claw as tomorrow I'm heading to St James' for my final physio appointment. After this I'm being referred to Monaghan General so that'll be a lot handier. I must be due a bit of luck too as a bird decided to crap on me while I was walking around town. All over my black hoodie too...

So a bit of a busy weekend. Friday night Paula was working so we went to McKennas for a few drinks. It didn't end up being too late but we did have a good chat to young Seamie at the end of the night. Went home after that and Paula eventually headed home at about five in the morning, this after being up for about 22 hours! Madness!

Saturday Paula decided to do her good deed for the day by agreeing to babysit for Caroline and Kevin who were heading out for a few drinks. So we got a DVD, 'Be Kind, Rewind' and watched it. Caroline and Kevin came home at about half one or so and we headed home. That was my first real babysitting duties since looking after Bronagh and Sean about ten years ago, and it's not like I did anything either. I think Paula was relieved that Ciara and Niamh didn't wake up. Apparently they'll have a few questions for her the next time they see her.

Monday was a bank holiday so we went out on Sunday night for a few more drinks. We sat upstairs in the Pig for most of the night, even Pauric made an appearance! We sat there chatting for a while, even managed to see Sherry for the first time since I've been back. We all headed to the Seasons after that and the night got a bit messy after that. Seamie was there though, I do remember that. We headed home after that and I went straight to bed, God only knows how I made it though.

Monday and today have been quieter affairs. Dad was heading down to Dublin with Barney so I hitched a lift with them, saved me a bit of money anyway. This time tomorrow the claw will be gone and I'll be heading back home, admittadly not with full use of my hand but at least it won't be as awkward.

Paddy.
