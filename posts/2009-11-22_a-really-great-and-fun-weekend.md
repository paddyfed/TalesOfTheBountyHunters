After the disappointment of the previous night (we watched the match in the flat and headed to the Pig for extra time but we probably shouldn't have bothered) I got up quite late and made my spaghetti sauce. I was working from five until nine so I couldn't play football but that was probably a good thing.

Friday was a bit better even though I was working the evening shift again. Paula did meet me in Tescos though and we bought a few things for dinner just before they closed. We had chicken supreme and we watched Adam and Jade play 'Left for Dead 2'. Though we quickly tired of this so we went to watch a DVD instead. Paula went home after that and I sat up and watched a few episodes of Futurama with Jade.

Saturday I had to be up early as I was heading to our neighbour Ann Gillanders' funeral. It was quite a long funeral and very sad and I really feel uncomfortable when you go to greet the family although I suppose it had to be done. We also heard that Seamie who worked as a bouncer in the Seasons and the Pig died so that really was a shock. We all went home for dinner and while everyone else had stew I was treated to a steak and I don't know why...or do I? We also watched [Ireland hammer Fiji](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2009/1121/ireland_fiji1.html) in the rugby which was entertaining if a bit one sided. Barney came down for a visit too but I headed out to Paulas house. Her mum and dad were heading to a dance and we watched [Match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1121/manunited_everton.html) [of](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1121/liverpool_mancity.html) [the](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1121/chelsea_wolves.html) [Day](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/1121/sunderland_arsenal.html) and 'Naked Gun' for the umpteenth time, still a classic though!

Today we didn't get up too early but after a good breakfast we headed to the cinema to finally see 'Up!' and it was fantastic. It was a lot funnier than I thought it would be and really sad at the start. I'd definitely watch it again. Paula left me out home for dinner and we were all home probably for the last time until Christmas. All in all it was a really good weekend. We didn't do anything spectacular but it was just stress free and fun just like it used to be and like it will be again.
