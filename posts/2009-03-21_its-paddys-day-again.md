So Paddy's day was upon us again. Although I was working for most of it we still made a good day of it. There wasn't too many people in the shop, well nobody buying anything anyway, and we managed to finish up early enough. I headed out to meet up with Paula, Ger, Steph and Adam in the Pig for a few drinks. Ger was telling me all about the United and Liverpool match that he was at the previous weekend and how he couldn't celebrate because he was in amongst the United fans. Serves him right!

On Wednesday I wasn't working so I headed out to Paulas house and we watched a DVD. It was Get Smart with Steve Carrell and it was ok, nothing spectacular however. Thursday I was back to work and it was Rachels last day. She is heading to work in Ilac for another week before finally heading to the store that she is supposed to be in, although she doesn't know where that is yet!.

Friday night we headed out to the Pig for a few drinks. Elaine was up and so was her friend Vikki. We stood talking for a while with Ciara and David O'Malley, I was actually in Digs in Letterkenny with him. We went to the Forum after that and it was quite empty but we did have a good time. We went back to the flat after that to collect Paulas things before they all went home. Tomorrow is the big day! Grand Slam decider! C'mon Ireland!

Paddy.
