So on Tuesday it was back to work time. I was working from one until six but as soon as I got there I wanted to go home. I just wasn't in the mood to be there. Thankfully it went quick enough and I wasn't mad all day. It was also the first time that we played football with Ben and his friends. It ended up being the GAME crew against the rest with Me, Adam, Ben and Neil on the one team. Most of the guys hadn't played in a long time so they were wrecked after a while.

We went to the west for a drink and then went home for something to eat. and today there wasn't much else happening. Paula was at the dentist this morning and she got on all right and tomorrow I promised to make dinner for her at around four so hopefully that'll turn out all right.

Paddy.
