Monday was the start of another boring week at work although the Christmas rush has definitely started. Football was on as well and it was a good match that saw the return of Stephen in goal and he's nearly impossible to score against! Paula was out walking that evening and her car broke down so she was really annoyed. I did avoid calling her which I shouldn't have done.

On Tuesday Paula came over to the flat and we said our sorry's for the night before. She wasn't really feeling that well though so she had a lie down for a while. Thankfully it was just a bit of a funny turn and she's grand. On Wednesday I came home from work and played the Rock Band drums for a while. I've started playing on medium mode to get a bit more of a challenge but I don't think I'll ever get to expert or even hard mode!

Gavin came on Xbox Live then and I chatted to him for a while. We're heading up to Belfast next Saturday to see Eddie Izzard so I'm really looking forward to that! Paula also came over for a while and we watched a DVD in the room.

So today I was working again and found out that I'm working tomorrow too. I was a bit annoyed about it but I can't really complain because it's a few extra hours. I was out at football too and thankfully it wasn't as frosty as Monday. I called Paula when I got home and we completely forgot that we had planed to go to a table quiz in the Pig! It was a Northern Sound quiz too so we may have joined Ger, Pauric et al in the final...

Well that went out the window but I did manage to upload the videos from the weekend. Classic...
