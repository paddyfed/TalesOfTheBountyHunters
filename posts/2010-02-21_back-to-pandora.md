I was working late on Friday and I didn't do much during the day at all. It was the usual quiet evening in the shop too but I did get to put up all the browser shelf strips so that kept me busy. I headed out to Paulas house after work with a Montie and we watched a few episodes of the Boosh, well I watched a few. Paula was very tired so she fell asleep in the middle of it. It's cute when she falls asleep on my shoulder.

I wasn't up too early on Saturday and Paula was out washing her car. She left Ger out to get his car fixed and we headed into town to get some fruit. We made dinner when we got back to the house and we headed to Armagh to see Avatar in 3D. [I'd seen it before](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2010/01/not-exactly-perfect-reunionbut-avatar.html) but Paula hadn't and she'd never been to a 3D movie either. She was very impressed by both. We got back home just before it really started snowing and we watched some of the Winter Olympics on the TV.

Again I wasn't up early today but I was awoken by the girls coming in to jump on me. We were relaxing in the house for the day and everyone was over for their dinner, well except Elaine. We did make a small excursion to Emyvale for some baby food and Paula left me out home so that I could have my dinner out there. She did come in for a while but she had to go home and try to study for a while. When I got back to the flat too the gate had somehow stuck and I couldn't get in. Thankfully Adam was in the flat to open it. It did do it once before but that was ages ago and I'm not so sure that it's to do with the cold weather. Oh and I sat up and watched [the Canadians get beaten by the U.S.A. in the ice hockey](http://www.rte.ie/sport/2010/0222/winterolympics.html). It wasn't that great of a match though.
