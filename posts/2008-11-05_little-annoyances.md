You know whats just a bit annoying? Making yourself some hot chocolate only to forget about it while you update your blog. Then you have to drink it cold, just in case you accidentaly decide to knock it over during the night.

In other news, I had my first physio appointment in Monaghan yesterday and they're really happy with the movement in my hand, especially so soon after the operation. I think I'll be back a good few times in the next few weeks though.

The U.S. election is on tonight too and hopefully Obama will get in. It'll be a few hours before we know the result though.

Paddy.
