Paula was over on Thursday evening and we had spaghetti for dinner which was lovely. She did give her head a knock before she left but thankfully she was alright. I was working on Friday and Paula collected me at the flat. We went looking for a rain jacket but we didn't have any luck. We also had a bit of a disagreement about work and going to Dublin for a shopping trip which put a sour note to the start of the weekend. She was also having trouble with her breathing on Friday evening which was a bit worrying to say the least.

Saturday was Edel and Colm's wedding day so we were up and had breakfast and then got ready to head to Scotstown. The ceremony was nice and we got some great photos of the girls and James in their nice clothes. We went to Seamus and Olives for tea afterwards and then headed to the Seasons for the reception. The food was fantastic and we couldn't fault the staff when Paula asked for the special menu. The speeches weren't too long either and they had a few special surprises for Ultan and Cormac who were celebrating their 18th and 21st Birthdays.

The band started up after that and I was a bit worried when the accordion made an appearance but they were actually fantastic and kept the crowd going all night. I spent a good lot of my time dancing with Ciara or Niamh but then again so did most of the guys there. They were so cute especially Niamh when you had to ask her to dance. The DJ that came on later wasn't great but most people were all danced out by that stage. We did have a disaster when rock the boat came on as Paulas dress broke and we had to make our way home. It really was a great day though.

So today we had to get up early again as we were heading to Clones to the Ulster final between Monaghan and Tyrone. We were all expecting great things from the Monaghan team but [unfortunately it didn't come to pass](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0718/monaghan_tyrone.html). We all headed home disappointed and very tired and got a take away from Emyvale for dinner. Paula and I did manage to go for a walk this evening and a man at the graveyard told us that he was sorry for our troubles.

Of course we were still wearing our Monaghan jerseys at the time!

Paddy.
