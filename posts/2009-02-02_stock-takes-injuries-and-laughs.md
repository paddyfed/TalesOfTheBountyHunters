We had our stock take on Monday and it was the quickest stock take ever in the shop. I think it's because everybody had been through a number of the by this stage and so we all knew what to expect. It was good craic too, for once. Tuesday we went to the Pig to watch the [Portsmouth and Villa](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0127/villa_portsmouth.html) match. It wasn't too bad but I was a bit more interested in the [Man United and Wigan](http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2009/0127/manunited_westbrom.html) match.

On Wednesday Adam went house hunting as he wanted to move out of his flat. He asked me to move in with him again and I decided that I would, even though I can't really afford it but at least I'll get a bit of independence. He found a flat on Glaslough Street and he says he's going to move in to it so I'll have to get some money together.

Thursday night was Football out in Ballinode and I wouldn't usually mention it but this was the night that I banged my knee off the goal post and was limping for the rest of the night. I think I stayed in goal for most of the match after that because I basically couldn't run.

Friday was the night that Neil Delamere was playing in Blaney. We went up and had a drink at the bar before going in . The guy on before Neil was quite good and Neil himself was excellent. He really got some good audience interaction so that was what made the show. After the gig we went back to town for a few drinks in the Pig. We met up with Adam and Shelly and I stood talking to Nikki Sherry. I also saw Cathal and Marie who are heading to Australia for a year and I was giving them some tips.

That night I stayed in Paulas house and the next day Ciara and Niamh came over. We also went to Emyvale to pick up a few things for dinner. After that we watched Stephanie's performance in the Wizard of Oz and it was very funny. That night Landers sent me a txt as they were drinking in McKenna's so I decided to join them. Was good craic and they were all a bit tipsy as they were drinking all day in Emyvale after coming back from the Rally. That night we ended up in the Forum doing the [SNL Jim Carrey dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpwK3vFGJp0).

Sunday was a day of rest and recovery after a long weekend. I did manage to watch [Superbowl XLIII](http://www.rte.ie/sport/other/2009/0202/superbowl.html) and it was a fantastic match! The Cardinals did so well to come back after losing by 13 points only to lose out in the final moments from a fantastic drive by the Steelers.

Next week, some more updates...
