Wow it's been a while since I updated here. That's what you get for getting a job and having no spare time. So what's been happening since? Well I splashed out and bought myself a Playstation 2 (one of the new thin ones) just so I could play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It's some game too, I'm not even half way through it yet and already it feels bigger than any other game I've ever played. I also got Fifa 2005 which seems good but I haven't played it that much and I bought a pre-owned Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 for &#8364;15, bargain or what!

I've also downloaded the trailer for Star Wars Episode III and it looks the business! I can't wait for more trailers and things to come out. I'll soon have to renew my Hyperspace account, I got it for Christmas last year so I assume that they'll notify me about it soon enough.

South Park episodes are back again and it's handy enough for me to go down town and download them, I would seriously love to get Broadband Internet at home but damn that whole distance thing!

I'm going to a 21st tonight which will be the first time that I've been out since Graduation. A good friend of mine, Skinny, is coming home from Scotland to have his party in Monaghan so it'll be good to get the old Mexx gang together again.
