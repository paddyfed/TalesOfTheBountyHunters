Later this morning I'll be heading down to Athlone to help my aunt out with her computer so I'll be away for a few days. However I'll have to be back in Monaghan on Saturday as we're heading out to a group dinner. So I think what I'll do is go to Dublin on Friday and then back home on Saturday. Of course I'm not sure how long things will take so it could change!

I do want to maybe get a new pair of jeans if I can manage it. It's been a good two years since I bought a good pair so it's about time I think.

I've a few other things to do to like put the new RAM into the girls computer. Plus I may buy The Orange Box even though I can't play it yet. I just want to try out my new graphics card. It's a Radeon HD 3650 and it seems to be going well so far. Also there might be one or two new books to get.

If I do come back up on Saturday I may just stay in town and get ready in the flat, that is if Adam will be about.

Paddy.
