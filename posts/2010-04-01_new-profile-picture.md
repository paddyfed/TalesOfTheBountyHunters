No it's not an April Fools joke but a new profile picture. Well I didn't think [the last one](/posts/2009-09-04_back-to-letterkenny) was still appropriate seeing as we [no longer hold the Grand Slam](/posts/2010-03-21_all-we-wanted-was-a-triple-crown) or even the Six Nations championship.

This was taken back in September at [Damian and Goretti's wedding](/posts/2009-09-28_damian-and-goretti).

Paddy.
