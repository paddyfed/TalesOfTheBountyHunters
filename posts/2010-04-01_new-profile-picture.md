No it's not an April Fools joke but a new profile picture. Well I didn't think [the last one](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/09/back-to-letterkenny.html) was still appropriate seeing as we [no longer hold the Grand Slam](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2010/03/all-we-wanted-was-triple-crown.html) or even the Six Nations championship.

This was taken back in September at [Damian and Goretti's wedding](http://paddy1138.blogspot.com/2009/09/damian-and-goretti.html).

Paddy.
