So it's the start of another week at work, how exciting! Last week was quite action packed (well the weekend was anyway). On Friday we met up with the girls in Coogee who we haven't seen in a while. We were in the Coogee Bay Hotel and it was a good night out. It was supposed to be Nicole and Mairead's last day with us in Sydney so we were celebrating.
> We weren't celebrating them leaving by the way, we were just giving them a great send off. Anyway that night was the first time that we'd met Kat's cousin Tom who was visiting from Perth. I didn't really get a chance to talk to him but he did seem like a sound fella at the time and how true that was. This was also the night that King and I were jiving with Mairead and Kat over beside the bar. After a while we swapped partners and after that we danced together. A bit gay I know but it was funny at the time.

Next day we went out for breakfast to have another goodbye to the girls and they left the flat at about three. Half an hour later they returned, turns out the travel agent booked them on the wrong flight! Bit of a balls for their plans to go to Perth. We met up with the girls again in Kings Cross and we also met up with Barry and Caroline who just arrived in Sydney.
> So Mairead and Nicole lost a bit of money on their flights but I think it all worked out OK in the end. That night we went to Mansions in the cross and this was the first time I'd been in there. It's an OK kind of pub but it's always a bit quiet but the bar is always busy so it takes ages to get served in it.

Sunday, after the girls again made us breakfast, we went out to Bondi to go to the market there. It finished up early cause a storm was a brewin! So we went back to Bondi Junction and started drinking in the 'Tea Gardens'. We then moved on to the 'Cock and Bull' for a bit of food and to finish off the drinking. I think we got home at about 2 in the morning so the next day at work was interesting!
> We also met up with Kat's girls in the Cock and Bull and had a bit of craic with them.

The girls finally got away on Monday, flying to Melbourne and then on to Perth. Hopefully they'll have a good time over there and have a house ready for us in March for the Grand Prix. Started playing football too, a work mate of the lads plays up at Waverly park on Tuesdays so I am getting some exercise at least!
> Well we never did make it down for the Grand Prix because it was the same weekend as Paddy's weekend and the playing football didn't last too long either. It was Craig who was playing a few times but after about two weeks nobody was turning up. It was good while it lasted though.

Not much else to report, there's a couple of good movies coming out soon so the cinema might be the entertainment of choice for the next while. Oh and it's nearly Australia day so that'll be fun.

G'day,
Paddy.
