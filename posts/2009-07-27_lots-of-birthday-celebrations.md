So we went out on Friday night for Martinas Birthday as planned. It was Me, Paula, Ciara, Martina and Nicola Sherry. We met up in the Pig and had a few drinks there including some cocktails and Smirnoff Mule. We then went to the Poc to meet a few of Martinas friends and we all eventually made it to the Forum. Although it wasn't packed we still made the most of it. We left Ciara home and then went back to the flat but Paula couldn't stay.

Paula was working on Saturday and I sat up in the flat watching the Hungarian GP qualifying. This was the qualifying round that [Massa got hit on the head](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/0725/massa.html) by flying debris. Hopefully he'll be alright though. Paula did come up to the flat for lunch and we went out to her house later to watch a DVD, it was "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" and it was quite good if not all that funny. I stayed in the hose that night.

Sunday we got up fairly late, I got to watch the [Hungarian GP](http://www.rte.ie/sport/motorsport/2009/0726/hungariangp.html) though. We then went out to Paulas Granny's house as they're renovating it. I think Christy and Nora are eventually going to live there. Paula then dropped me into town and we met up later for dinner in the Pig which was lovely. We headed back to the flat for a while and then met up with Ciara in the Poc to celebrate her Birthday. Emma and Niamh were out too and we got to talk to them for a while. We didn't go to the Forum though as we headed back to the flat after the band had finished.

So that brings us up to today and I was working from one to six. It was quite busy too, actually sold a good bit of hardware. I also played football for the first time since being sick, I didn't manage to win but it's good to get back in to it.

Paddy.
