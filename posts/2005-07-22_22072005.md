So it's been two weeks since Oxegen and I've just about recovered from the severe sun burn that I got. The weather was brilliant on the Saturday and Sunday. In fact it was too good. I have to say that Green Day rocked the whole weekend. They were by far the best band there and they really put on a good show. Other worthy mentions go to Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs. Of course The Killers and The Foo Fighters were great too. It was just a brilliant weekend.

Got some new games recently. I've just this minute finished 'Star Wars Republic Commando' which wasn't too bad. The enemy AI wasn't great but the tougher droids could be annoying sometimes. There's one bit near the end with a spider droid that had me in knots trying to complete it. I've also got 'Half-Life 2' and 'God of War' on the PS2. I haven't played 'Half-Life' and I've only had a short go on 'God of War' but it seems good so far. I also got 'Advance Wars' for the GBA and it seems like an addictive wee game. I'd love to play it with two or more players though.
