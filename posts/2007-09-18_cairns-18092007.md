So I think we're proper tourists now. On Saturday we went on the Skyrail here in Cairns. It's just a cable car ride up through the Rainforest. It was really cool especially looking out at Barron Falls waterfall.

> The Skyrail was a really enjoyable day. We went up on the bus and nearly got lost trying to find the building as they were fixing the road or the car park or something and they had bits fenced off. So a skip and a jump over a fence later and we finally got in. The scenery from the cable car was unbelievable especially as you got higher and higher up the mountain. It was also quite a long trip and the nature walks were quite interesting.

The sky rail takes you from Smithfield to Kuranda and once we got off at Kuranda you'll never guess what we found! Yep the only pub in the town was an Irish pub! They're everywhere!
> It was called Fanny O'Reilly's Irish Bar and Grill and of course we had to go in for a few drinks and a bite to eat.

To get back to Cairns we took the Kuranda scenic railway all the way back to Cairns Central. That was really good too. Very scenic as the name suggests.
> The train trip was much longer than the cable car trip as it wound it's way from Kuranda to Cairns. Some of the drops from the side of the train were pretty big and you got great views of the valleys.

That evening of course was Arj Barker and I have to say he was brilliant! I wasn't expecting him to be quite that funny but he did put in a few 'Star Wars' and 'Lord of the Rings' references so that made my night. That night we went looking for somewhere that was playing the Ireland match and yet again it seems that nowhere was open at the right time.
> We tried a few other pubs this night too like the Mad Cow Tavern, which we all agreed was terrible, and I think we went back to Tropos just to remind ourselves how bad it was too. This was also the night of the now infamous shopping trolley incident. If you don't know what happened then you'll just have to ask Landers, Sweets or Myself the next time you see us. Even then they may not tell you.

If we don't get into the quarter finals (which is looking more and more likely at the minute) then we might not get to see any of Ireland's matches.

At least England are doing shit too,
Paddy.
