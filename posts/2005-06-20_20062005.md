Well I haven't updated in a long time because I've been kind of busy. Plus I really didn't want to write about Liverpool and the FA cup final cause it's still hard to swallow. Anyway on to better things.

Episode III was just unbelievable! we went to see it twice on the 19th as planned and the screen was absolutely huge. There wasn't much of a crowd when we went to see it the first time either so it was nice and relaxed in the cinema, even though my stomach was up in knots. It was one of those moments where you couldn't believe it was actually happening. We managed to watch all of the other movies back to back and in order of release the night before. It took a long time, I don't think we were finished until about half two in the morning. I didn't manage to watch the Clone Wars cartoons but I don't think it really mattered in the end.

What else has happened? We've just come back from a great weekend in the Isle of Mann. We went over for my two nephews confirmation and we had an action packed time. We got to see some of the sites of the island on Saturday when we went to the Laxey Wheel on the electric tram and we had a great day at Onchan Pleasure Park on Sunday before we had to leave.
