Monday was a bank holiday and I wasn't working. Instead I did a bit of work on the site and managed to order Orko and Mo-Larr successfully. There seemed to be loads of them too as I didn't see many complaints. That night we went to the cinema in Dundalk to see "The A-Team". There was a big group of us too. Me and Paula, Edel Ciara, Gerrard, Elaine, Kevin and Michael Quinn, Stephanie and Adam, Pauric and Sinead, Addie Jebb and Mark Genoe. It was a brilliant film too, bit dumb in places but entertaining.

On Tuesday I was working from twelve to six and went out to Paulas house for dinner. Adam is on holidays in Spain so there was plenty of hours going in the shop. I was very tired that evening though.

I was in work all day Wednesday too. Paula came over to the flat for dinner this time though and we had steak. We watched a few episodes of "The IT Crowd" and she decided to stay the night.

Paula was up for work early on Thursday and I was in at one. It was a quiet day and I had to miss football because of it. Paula went shopping in Dundalk but she didn't get anything. Although she did buy me a waterproof jacket which I have needed for a long time.

I was working all day Friday and mostly changed a few light bulbs in the shop. Paula came over and got the keys and had dinner ready when I got back to the flat. We then headed down to Gorey for the weekend. We got to Elaines house and dumped the bags and headed to Ted and Eileens house and stayed a while.

On Saturday we got up late and went into Gorey for some shopping. There wasn't much about so we went to Arcklow too and Paula bought a few clothes. We had food in Eddie Rockets and then went back to Eileens. Elinor, Eibhlin and Siobhan were all there too. When we got back to the house we were tired and went to go to the cinema only to find that there wasn't any late show. So instead we went to Nel Sweeneys for a few drinks and got back to the house around half one.

So today we went out to Elinors for a while and saw her house all finished. It was looking fantastic. We also went out to Courtown for a spin and I think we were there once before years ago because I can vaguely remember the Pirates Cove adventure golf. We then took a spin out to Eileen and Teds and we saw the [Kilkenny and Cork hurling match](http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0808/kilkenny_cork.html). We then said our goodbyes, went and made dinner and headed home.

Paddy.
