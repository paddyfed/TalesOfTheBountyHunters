There was football on Monday as usual and for the second week in a row I managed to hurt my knee. My right knee knocked against my left knee and it was sore for ages after it. I put it in ice when I got home but it was still sore. We went for pizza after the football too but Shelly had forgotten to put ours on so we got it delivered instead. The gate still wasn't working but thankfully it was left open when we got back.

On Tuesday I'd planned to go walking with Paula but the weather had other plans as it started to snow quite heavily. I also felt quite fed up today for no real reason, just a bit lonely in the flat I guess. We made up for it on Wednesday though as I headed out to Paulas house for dinner. We sat and watched TV for the evening and just relaxed.

I didn't go out to football today because of my knee and I'm glad I did because I just chilled out in the flat after work. I got an email from Debinhams too that Paulas dress was ready for collection. Paula then came over to collect my credit card so that she could collect it tomorrow.

Paddy.
