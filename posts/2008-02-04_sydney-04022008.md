So what happened this week then? Not much truth be told. The week was taken up by work of which I didn't do much either. Had a great day on Wednesday as three of the four people I organised interviews with decided not to turn up without telling us. Nice. Apart from that it was boring as ever.
> Yea that was a great day at work. I really thought that I'd get someone in to a job finally but only for them to not turn up. I think two of them were for the same client too so I had to call him twice in the space of an hour telling him that our candidates wouldn't be turning up. I really lost all faith in recruitment as a career then!

Friday night Darren and I went down to Coogee to meet the Girls as it was Lauren's Birthday. Decent night but we did see a crap row and had a bit of trouble getting drinks in the nightclub (what do you mean you don't serve doubles?).
> That was a really strange night. The row started when someone threw a tray at another guy and they both just had a bit of a slapping match for a while. It was unusual though because we hadn't seen many rows in Australia at all! And the no doubles rule is stupid, OK I'll just have two then and put them into the one glass! Idiots!

Saturday we went into town and did a bit of bowling and then went to the Maritime Museum and had a tour round a submarine and WWI gunship in Darling Harbour. We also took Odie around the Opera House. That night we went out to PJ's to watch the Rugby and thankfully they showed the full game and with commentary. [Right result but still unconvincing from Ireland](http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/sixnations/2008/0202/irelandrugby1.html). At least England lost and I expected France to win too. France next.
> The tour around the harbour was really good. It was really interesting to see the ship and the cramped conditions in the submarine. It was especially difficult for Landers. The funny ting about that match was that when D'Arcy got injured we actually knew about it before anyone in Ireland because Edel had a friend working in the x-ray department when he came in. So we knew he'd be out for the rest of the tournament.

After that we tried to go to 'Home' nightclub but it was closed So we went to Subway instead.
> Ahhh Subway. And now there's one open in Monaghan!

Sunday we had planned to go to Bondi for dinner with the girls but it was on a bit too early for us. Instead we went for a few drinks in the Mercantile which was good craic. So Odie is leaving us on Thursday and it looks like it's not going to stop raining until she leaves so I don't know if we'll be able to do much. We'll be out for a few drinks on Wednesday to say our goodbyes so if anybody is about you're more than welcome.

Ta, ta for now,
Paddy
