So on Monday we had a new member of staff in the shop. Rachel was a trainee deputy manager and she was up with us learning the ropes. She's actually very nice and as it turns out her maiden name was O'Hara so that was a bit unusual. So tat was the craic in work. Played Star Wars Battlefront II on the XBOX that evening too. No football again because of the ankle.

Tuesday was Pancake Tuesday so I went home for my dinner. Edel and Becky came down the road too although they didn't stay the night. Ken was over too and it was a bit weird having everyone in the house. Fantastic pancakes though!

Didn't do much on Wednesday but on Thursday Paula came over to the flat for a visit. We watched the new Futurama film and although it was a bit nerdy Paula did actually enjoy it. On Friday I went to the doctors to see about my ankle as it was still sore. He said that it wasn't broken but that he was sending me for an x-ray to make sure. He was also a bit sketchy on the details about what would happen if it was broken though. He said worst case scenario I would have to have an operation which I wasn't happy about at all! Paula did come over to the flat to cheer me up though which was nice.

Tomorrow I'm heading down to Dublin for an Australia reunion! Good times ahead and it'll keep my mind off the ankle!
