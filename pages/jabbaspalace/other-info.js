      daily life is mostly taken up with the contemplation of the Universe. When
      a monk becomes 'enlightened', the other monks remove his brain and place
      it in a nutrient enriched jar where it is free to contemplate the universe
      without bodily distractions. After a while the monk may request to use a
      brain walker so that he can move about the palace.

      They feed on the life force and luck of ordinary people, Soup, by drinking
      it through proboscis that come from cheek pouches, leaving no evidence of
      the kill. Some citizens of the galaxy don't believe that such a creature
      exists and dismiss them as fairy tales or rumour.
      <h3>Vehicles</h3>

        <a name="barge">Sail Barge</a>
      </h4>
      Jabba's pleasure craft, usually used for trips into the Dune Sea, the Pit
      of Carkoon or to Mos Eisley. Luke Skywalker blew up the sail barge at the
