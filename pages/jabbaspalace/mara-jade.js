      <br />
      Emperor Palpatine sent Mara, as the Emperors Hand, to Tatooine in an
      attempt to kill the last remaining Jedi, Luke Skywalker. She made her way
      to Jabba's palace and posed as the dancer Arica in the bloated one's
      court.

        She waited patiently for the moment that Skywalker would arrive to save
        his friend, Han Solo, who was encased in carbonite and hanging in
        Jabba's throne room.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Luke finally arrived she became sloppy. She slowly took a blaster
        from one of Jabba's guards while Skywalker was talking to Jabba. However
        she did not realise that another dancer, Melina, was watching her.
        Thinking she was trying to assassinate Jabba, Melina pulled out her own
        blaster and brought Mara back to a side chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dancer confronted Mara and told her that Jabba would give her a
        reward if she turned her in. Mara, now furious with herself, used mind
        tricks on Jabba's Gammorrian guards to distract Melina and escape. By
        this time Skywalker had killed Jabba's Rancor and was to be sent to the
        Sarlacc Pit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having missed her first chance to kill Skywalker, Mara tried to join the
        trip to the Sarlacc on Jabba's Sail Barge. She pleaded with Jabba to let
        her go with them but she was unsuccessful. Perhaps Jabba knew who she
        was and was not about to let her spoil his fun at the Great Pit of
        Carkoon. Mara was left behind at the palace.
      </p>
      <b>Outcome:</b>

      Emperor Palpatine contacted Mara. She told him of her failure. Palpatine
      ordered her to go to the planet Svivren and wait for further instructions.
      After the Emperor was killed, Mara soon joined the Smuggler, Talon Karrde
      and stayed with him for many years.
      <p>
        When she finally met up with Skywalker she again tried to kill him,
        finishing the final orders given to her by the Emperor. She failed again
        and Luke turned her from the Dark Side of the Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke trained her in the light side of the Force and she became a Jedi.
      </p>
      <p>
        After nine years of getting to know and trust Luke, Mara Jade married
        him in an Ironic twist of fate.
      </p>
      <b>My Opinion:</b>
      <br />
      Mara's plan, although seemingly foolproof, was in fact never going to
      work. Mara was obviously skilled enough to make her way to Jabba's palace
      and gain admittance to the throne room. However her inexperience showed
      when she allowed a dancer to creep up on her and capture her just at the
      moment that she was about to strike at Luke.
      <p>
        It was only after the death of the Emperor and her many years with
        Karrde that she gained her experience as a fighter.
