        <b>Plot:</b>
        <br />
        To kill Jabba and take over his clean businesses
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Reason:</b>
        <br />
        For money, to be free from Jabba

        <b>Action Taken:</b>
        <br />
        When Tessk left Mon Calamari he found his way to Jabba's palace. Here he
        worked for the Hutt as his accountant and all around businessman. He
        looked after a lot of Jabba's interests on Tatooine, some legal and some
        not so legal. However he diverted a lot of credits into Jabba's clean
        businesses.

        />
        He constantly tried to get Jabba into trouble. He organised an ambush
        for Jabba in which the Imperial prefect, Talmont, would capture Jabba
        while the Hutt was inspecting a spice shipment in his warehouse near Mos
        Eisley. Tessk would then detonate a bomb, killing both Jabba and
        Talmont.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had everything set. A bomb was placed on the sail barge and Tessk was
        ready to sell Jabba's criminal businesses to Lady Valarian while he kept
        the clean ones. However the B’omarr monks warned him that his plan would
        fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Luke Skywalker arrived in the palace Tessk was unnerved. He thought
        that the Rebel Alliance would storm the palace and kill everyone to save
        Han Solo. He changed his plans, he now wanted to kill Jabba at the Pit
        of Carkoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        He placed a speeder on the Sail Barge and went along to the Sarlacc.
        While he waited for the Rebel Alliance to arrive, Luke Skywalker created
        havoc on the barge. Tessk soon realised that the Rebel Alliance was not
        coming. He got on his speeder and left the sail barge before Luke blew
        it up.

        <b>Outcome:</b>
        <br />
        <img

        />
        When he got back to the palace he found it was relatively deserted. The
        B’omarr monks came towards him and forcibly removed his brain, placing
        it in a nutrient jar. He remained there for a while but he received a
        brain walker so that he could move around the palace. He was finally
        free from Jabba.

        <b>My Opinion:</b>
        <br />
        If <a href="bib.html">Bib Fortuna's</a> plot was the most likely to
        work, then Tessk's must have been the second most likely. He had it
        planned out well, and included many other able bodied persons to help
        him (<a href="reeyees.html">Ree-Yees</a> excepted). He also had the
        patience to see it through.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with Bib, Tessk became reckless when the Rebel Alliance came along.
        He quickly had to change his plans, which meant that they weren't as
        foolproof as he would've wanted.
      </p>
      <p>His modified plot was destined to fail.</p>
