      Bib Fortuna
      <b>Species:</b>
      Twi'lek, Male
      <b>Occupation:</b>
      Jabba's Major-domo
      <p>
        <b>Plot:</b>
        <br />
        To take over Jabba's Empire, to take over Rayloth
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reason:</b>
        <br />
        Money, Power
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Co-Conspirators:</b>
        <br />
        B'ommar Monks, Nat Secura, other spies inside the palace
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Action Taken:</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      When Bib Fortuna left his home world of Rayloth he vowed to come back and
      rule the Planet. He took an infant, Nat Secura, with him. Nat was the last
      surviving member of a clan on Rayloth and Bib knew that he would be
      helpful when he decided to return. He made his way to Jabba's palace on
      Tatooine and soon became Jabba's Major-domo or right-hand man.
      <p>
        Bib was not happy with his situation. He longed to get rid of Jabba and
        take over his empire. He began conversing with the B'ommar monks in the
        palace and planned the demise of the Hutt. He constantly had to protect
        Nat from Jabba, even going as far as letting the monks remove Nat's br
        /ain and letting Jabba feed the now empty body to the Rancor.
      </p>
      <p>
        He searched the palace for secret passages and got security codes for
        many of the Hutt's accounts. When Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia came
        to the palace to free Han Solo, Bib advanced his plans to kill Jabba. He
        had originally planned to feed Jabba to the Rancor but Luke stopped that
        idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        He placed his personal speeder bike on the sail barge and went with
        Jabba to the Pit of Carkoon, taking with him a thermal detonator, which
        he would use to kill the Hutt and then return to take over the palace.
      </p>
      <b>Outcome:</b>
      <br />
      Bib never got the chance to use his Thermal detonator before Luke blew up
      the barge. Instead he left the barge on his speeder and made his way back
      to the palace, expecting to take over Jabba's empire as planned. When he
      got there, however, the B'ommar Monks were waiting for him.
      <p>
        His br /ain was forcibly removed and placed in a nutrient jar. After a
        while he and Nat got br /ain walkers and began looking for cloning
        technology so that they may grow new bodies for themselves.
      </p>
      <b>My Opinion:</b>
      <br />
      Bib's plot, out of all the other plots in the palace, was the most likely
      to have worked. Bib showed great patience with his dealings with the Hutt
      and he could've waited a lot longer before making his move. It is only
      with the introduction of the Rebel Alliance heroes that he became reckless
      and lost some of his nerve.
      <p>When this happened Bib Fortuna's plan was destined to fail.</p>
